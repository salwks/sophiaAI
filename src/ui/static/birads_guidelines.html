The difference is that category 1 should be used when no specific benign finding is described in the report, whereas category 2 should be used when at least one benign finding is described. Note that this difference relates to whether benign findings are described in the report, not whether such findings are visible at examination. It is recommended that all radiologists who work at a given mammography facility collectively agree on whether and when to describe benign findings in the report; hence, when to use category 1 versus category 2.</div>

Involuting calcified fibroadenomas, skin calcifications, metallic foreign bodies (e.g., core biopsy and surgical clips), and fat-containing masses (e.g., oil cysts, lipomas, galactoceles, and hamartomas) all have characteristically benign appearances and may be described with confidence. The interpreting radiologist may also choose to describe intramammary lymph nodes, vascular calcifications, implants, or architectural distortion clearly related to prior surgery while still concluding that there is no mammographic evidence of malignancy. However, the interpreter may choose not to describe such findings, in which case the examination should be assessed as negative (category 1).</div>

Use of category 3 in  $\leq$  5% of examinations has been shown to be achievable in practice [17–19, 22, 35]. While some studies, particularly from 15–20 years ago, showed category 3 use rates as high as 20–24% [16, 27, 36], multiple more recent studies across patient populations and clinical indications have demonstrated lower category 3 frequencies ranging from 3% to 14%, with most in the 5% to10% range [19, 37, 38] [4, 17–19, 21, 22, 24–26, 28–30, 35, 37–40]. The more recent lower use rates are likely due to multiple factors such as improved techniques, greater radiologist experience including recognition of BPE patterns, and presence of comparison MRI examinations [36].</div>

                <div class="document-content">Studies have typically evaluated category 3 findings' individual features, and no individual feature such as finding type or other descriptor has been shown to confer a likelihood of malignancy  $\leq 2\%$  [4, 6, 15, 21, 31, 32]. In practice, combinations of features are used in assessment. In the absence of robust data for combinations of features, guidance regarding the specific imaging findings appropriate to place in category 3 remains limited.

In general, mass individual features most frequently associated with benignity include oval shape, circumscribed margin, homogeneous or dark internal septations, T2 hyperintensity, and persistent delayed-phase kinetics. None of these features alone is sufficient to assign category 3 [6], as cancers can present with these individual features, including T2 hyperintensity [33].

In general, non-mass individual features most frequently associated with benignity include focal or regional distribution and homogeneous internal enhancement. None of these features alone is sufficient to assign category 3, as cancers can present with these individual features.

Of note, non-mass enhancement which is slightly unique but associated with adjacent cysts is typically benign [34].

Based on the existing data [6] and expert practice, a mass that is oval and circumscribed and has homogeneous internal enhancement or dark internal septations and is T2 hyperintense has a likelihood of cancer  $\leq 2\%$  and could be assessed as at most category 3. The use of category 3 for other MRI findings types should be infrequent and remains based on individual and practice experience.

BPE is present on many breast MRI examinations and is normal finding. Radiologists should be familiar with the variety of patterns that are normal including asymmetric BPE. Rarely, there may be enhancement that is almost certainly but not definitely asymmetric BPE, for which a category 3 assessment could be considered.</div>

                <div class="document-content">While an early study from nearly 20 years ago showed a category 3 malignancy rate of approximately 24% [16], multiple subsequent studies demonstrated category 3 malignancy rates ranging from 0% to 6% [4, 17–30], with frequencies in most studies  $\leq$  2% and a metanalysis pooled frequency of 1.6% [15]. These studies indicate that despite heterogeneity of use across patients, clinical indications and findings, category 3 can be employed in practice with malignancy rates in the appropriate  $\leq$  2% range.

Caution should be used when considering category 3 for findings on non-baseline examinations, since one study showed that the category 3 malignancy rate was 2% in baseline examinations but 9% in the non-baseline setting [19].

Also, there are sparse data regarding the stage of diagnosis for the subset of category 3 findings that prove to be malignant, with some evidence confirming that early stage at diagnosis is still achievable [19]. Further studies are needed to confirm the early-stage diagnoses for BI-RADS category 3 findings that are found to be malignant.</div>

Findings that decrease or resolve or are interpreted as benign by a more experienced reader at 6 or 12 months should be assessed as category 2 with no additional recommended follow-up. Findings that remain present and stable with probably benign appearance should be assessed at 6 and 12 months as category 3 and at 24 months as category 2. An increase, progression or otherwise more suspicious appearance of category 3 findings at follow-up should prompt a category 4 or 5 assessment based on the imaging findings and a recommendation for tissue sampling. Follow-up at each interval is important, as malignancies have been demonstrated as early as 6 months [4, 15, 18, 19] and as late as 24 months [15].</div>

Breast MRI findings which might be assessed as category 3 in other clinical scenarios should be assigned category 4A in the setting of current breast cancer. This is because the goal of breast MRI for current cancer is to establish the extent of malignancy in the near-term to guide management decisions. A category 3 assessment with a short interval follow-up recommendation does not result in near-term tissue diagnosis to establish the extent of disease. Only very rarely, category 3 could be used in the current cancer setting based on particular patient or imaging considerations.</div>

                <div class="document-content">A finding assessed using this category should have a  $\leq 2\%$  likelihood of malignancy, but greater than the essentially 0% likelihood of malignancy of a characteristically benign finding. A category 3 assessment should not be given on a screening examination but only after complete diagnostic imaging evaluation. Rendering category 3 assessments directly from screening examination has been shown to result in adverse outcomes: 1) unnecessary follow-up of many findings that could have been promptly assessed as benign, and 2) delayed diagnosis of a small number of cancers that otherwise may have been smaller in size and less likely to be advanced in stage if confirmed on diagnostic evaluation of an equivocal screening finding [44]. A probably benign finding is not expected to change over the suggested period of imaging surveillance, but the interpreting physician needs to establish stability of the finding before recommending routine mammography screening, as there is a small possibility of malignancy. A BI-RADS category 3 assessment is not an indeterminate category used when the radiologist is simply unsure whether to render a benign (BI-RADS category 2) or suspicious (BI-RADS category 4) assessment, nor should this category be used "to wait and see what happens."

There is robust literature describing three findings seen on **baseline** mammography followed by diagnostic work-up that have likelihoods of malignancy in the category 3 assessment range [45–47]. These are a (1) solitary noncalcified circumscribed solid mass, (2) focal asymmetry without an ultrasound correlate, and (3) solitary group of round calcifications. Assessment category 3 for mammographic findings other than these three should be considered only in situations where the radiologist has knowledge and personal experience with a sufficient number of cases to suggest that watchful waiting may be justified (e.g. equivocal calcifications developing at the site of prior surgery felt to be evolving fat necrosis, focal asymmetry at the site of recent trauma) [44].

The use of a probably benign assessment for a palpable lesion with probably benign features is supported by several small, retrospective, single-institution studies that report successful

outcomes for palpable lesions with probably benign imaging features [48–52]. Finally, because evidence from previously cited studies indicates the need for biopsy rather than continued surveillance when a probably benign finding increases in size or extent [45–47], it is generally not recommended to render a category 3 assessment when a finding that otherwise meets "probably benign" imaging criteria is either new or has substantially increased in size or extent.

For category 3 assessments, the initial short-term follow-up interval is usually 6 months, involving the breast(s) containing the probably benign finding(s). A follow-up interval of less than 6 months is typically reserved for cases of infection, inflammation, or trauma, where changes on imaging are expected and often a definitive BI-RADS 2 assessment could be rendered. Assuming stability at this 6-month examination, a category 3 assessment again will be rendered with a management recommendation for a second short-interval follow-up examination in 6 months but now involving both breasts if the opposite breast is due for routine annual screening. Again, assuming stability at this second short-interval follow-up, the examination is once more assessed as category 3, but now the recommended follow-up interval is generally lengthened to 1-year due to the already observed 12-month stability. Note that although the 1-year follow-up coincides with the routine screening interval in the United States, a category 3 assessment still should be rendered to indicate that the period of continued mammographic surveillance is still underway, and that diagnostic rather than screening mammography is indicated. After 2 years of stability, the final assessment category should be changed to benign (BI-RADS category 2) [50].

If during the course of surveillance the probably benign finding decreases in size or disappears, or now displays definitively benign characteristics, then the appropriate assessment would become benign (BI-RADS category 2) or negative (BI-RADS category 1), with return to a routine screening schedule. Alternatively, if the finding becomes more suspicious during the surveillance cycle, it should be assessed as a BI-RADS category 4 or 5, and biopsy should be pursued immediately.

One may encounter the scenario in which the patient or referring clinician requests that a probably benign finding be biopsied. In this scenario, the correct approach is to render a probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) assessment with a concordant management recommendation for short-interval or surveillance mammography, but to follow this with a sentence indicating that tissue diagnosis will be performed instead, due to patient or referring clinician preference.</div>

                <div class="document-content">A category 3 assessment indicates that a finding is identified as having a very low (≤ 2%) likelihood of malignancy. To establish benignity of a solid mass with benign morphology, surveillance imaging is necessary to document long-term stability. The initial follow-up interval is usually 6 months, involving the breast(s) containing the probably benign finding(s). Assuming stability at this 6-month examination, a category 3 assessment again is rendered with a recommendation for a second follow-up examination in 6 months. Again, assuming stability at this second follow-up, the examination is once more assessed as category 3, but now the recommended follow-up interval usually is lengthened to 1 year due to the already-established 12-month stability. Note that although the 1-year follow-up coincides with the routine screening interval in the United States, a category 3 assessment is nonetheless rendered, to indicate that the period of imaging surveillance is still underway and the subsequent examination should be scheduled as diagnostic rather than screening. Assuming stability at the 24-month US exam, a category 3 assessment may optionally be rendered with a recommended follow-up interval exam in an additional 12 months. As with surveillance using mammography, after establishing 2 years of stability, the final assessment category may be changed to benign (BI-RADS category 2). A benign evaluation may also be rendered before completion of category 3 analysis if, in the opinion of the radiologist, the finding has no chance of malignancy and is thus a category 2. Alternatively, during surveillance imaging, if the probably benign mass changes in morphology or increases in size, the final assessment should be changed to suspicious (BI-RADS category 4) with recommendation for biopsy.

There are some imaging findings with suspicious features that overlap between benign and malignant, but the clinical scenario and mammographic features strongly favor a benign etiology such as an abscess, hematoma, fat necrosis, or reactive lymph node. Although suspicious sonographic features such as angular margin, and non-parallel orientation may be present, the radiologist, in the appropriate clinical setting, may justifiably believe that the abnormality will decrease or resolve at follow-up. In these unique scenarios, a category 3 assessment can be rendered with a short-term interval follow-up ultrasound to avoid biopsy. In these select cases, the follow-up period may be less than the usual 6 months for findings expected to change over a shorter time frame (e.g., probable hematoma presenting as a mixed solid and cystic

mass directly at the site of known trauma). For suspected abscess treated with antibiotics or post-traumatic hematoma, the interval may be as short as 2–4 weeks. If the abnormality resolves or decreases in size at follow-up, an assessment of negative (BI-RADS category 1) or benign (BI-RADS category 2) can be rendered without 2 years of follow-up. On the other hand, if an abnormality with suspicious features fails to resolve or increases in size, biopsy may be indicated.

Assessment category 3, probably benign, is **not** an indeterminate category for use when the radiologist is unsure whether to render a benign (BI-RADS category 2) or suspicious (BI-RADS category 4) assessment. Assessment category 3 is specifically reserved for imaging findings known to have > 0% but  $\le 2\%$  likelihood of malignancy. For US, there is robust evidence that a solid mass with a circumscribed margin, oval shape, and parallel orientation (most commonly fibroadenoma), and an isolated complicated cyst (with diffuse low-level nonmobile internal echoes that cannot be confidently distinguished from a circumscribed hypoechoic solid mass) have a likelihood of malignancy in the defined ( $\le 2\%$ ) probably benign range, for which short-interval (6-month) follow-up sonography and then periodic sonographic surveillance may represent appropriate management [76–78]. The use of assessment category 3 for sonographic findings other than these two should be considered only if the radiologist has personal experience to justify a watchful-waiting approach, preferably involving observation of a sufficient number of cases of the sonographic finding to suggest a likelihood of malignancy within the defined ( $\le 2\%$ ) probably benign range.

As with screening mammography, category 3 assessment should not be made at screening US. In theory, a finding at screening ultrasound warrants a category 0 assessment with additional imaging to include diagnostic US. When appropriate, the category 3 assessment should then be issued on the subsequent diagnostic US exam. However, in practicality, screening US is often interpreted online, and when needed, additional US views are obtained as part of the diagnostic US examination while the patient remains in the breast imaging facility. In this scenario, it may be cumbersome to issue two separate breast US reports for the screening and diagnostic US exams. Thus, a single breast imaging report may be issued that combines the findings of both screening and diagnostic components of the examination. Hence, this combined report may render a category 3 assessment because the screening and diagnostic workup are essentially completed simultaneously (but each is audited separately "behind the scenes"). (This issue is discussed in more detail in Frequently Asked Question #2 for US in the Audit and Outcomes Monitoring section on page 856). Note that for auditing purposes (which may be separate from reporting), the screening component of such a category 3 assessed US examination will be audit-positive because additional imaging beyond standard images were obtained (BI-RADS category 0) but the diagnostic portion will be audit-negative because a biopsy recommendation was not issued.</div>

                <div class="document-content">A category 4 assessment is used for findings that are sufficiently suspicious to warrant tissue diagnosis but not pathognomonic for cancer. According to BI-RADS definitions expressed in terms of likelihood of malignancy, category 4 findings have a > 2 but < 95% chance of malignancy. As established in the BI-RADS 5th Edition, the management recommendation "biopsy should be performed in the absence of clinical contraindication" unequivocally specifies tissue diagnosis as the interpreting physician's management recommendation and allows the referring provider and patient to discuss any medical concerns or contraindications to biopsy.

Many institutions have subdivided category 4 into low suspicion (4A), moderate suspicion (4B), and high suspicion (4C) to account for the wide range of findings subjected to interventional procedures and corresponding broad range of likelihood of malignancy. This allows a more meaningful practice audit, is useful in research involving receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and is an aid for patients, clinicians, and pathologists to more readily make informed decisions on the ultimate course of action. The subdivisions of category 4 are discussed in more detail in the Guidance section.</div>

Consistent use of the subdivisions of category 4 may inform nuanced management of benign results.

This assessment was established at a time when surgical excision was used as the primary means of tissue diagnosis. Category 5 assessments were used for those findings that had such characteristic features of cancer (such as an irregular, spiculated, high density mass with associated microcalcifications or new fine linear and branching calcifications in a segmental distribution) that one-stage surgical treatment might be performed immediately following frozen-section histological confirmation of malignancy. Today, breast cancer diagnosis for imaging-detected findings almost always involves percutaneous tissue sampling, so the current rationale for using a category 5 assessment is to identify findings for which any nonmalignant percutaneous tissue diagnosis is typically considered discordant, resulting in the recommendation for repeat (usually surgical) biopsy. Note that there is no single mammographic feature that is associated with a likelihood of malignancy of  $\geq 95\%$ . Just as for breast US and MRI examinations, a combination of suspicious imaging features is required to justify a category 5 assessment.

When further breast imaging is performed prior to definitive treatment of a biopsy-proven malignancy and additional suspicious findings other than the known cancer are demonstrated, a category 6 assessment is not appropriate. It must be clearly communicated that besides the known malignancy, there are one or more findings requiring specific prompt action. The single overall assessment should be based on the most immediate action needed. If, at additional imaging, no other suspicious finding is identified, then a category 6 assessment should be rendered accompanied by the recommendation that subsequent management should be directed to the known cancer. As for any examination in which there is more than one finding, the management section of the report may include a second sentence that describes the appropriate management for the finding(s) not covered by the overall assessment.

It should also be used for more extensive enhancing findings for which there is a high certainty of malignancy, typically because they have the same morphology as the biopsy-proven malignancy.

Category 6 may also be used for separate additional close findings (ACFs) that are suspicious but not definitively malignancy when all of the following criteria are met: 1) They are within 2 cm of the biopsy-proven malignancy, 2) They do not increase the total extent by more than 2 cm, and 3) It is felt they would not change clinical management such as prompting a significantly larger surgery. Whether such findings would impact management will be influenced by multiple factors including extent of the known breast cancer and preferences and patterns in a particular practice. The ACFs should be fully reported including sizes and relationships relative to the biopsy-proven malignancy. The term "satellite" should not be used for such findings, as it is not sufficiently defined including the level of concern for malignancy and proximity to the primary malignancy.

Other separate suspicious breast findings that do not meet the criteria (high certainty of malignancy or ACF) in the two paragraphs above should typically be given a separate assessment of category 0, 4 or 5, as appropriate based on their appearances.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">A category 6 assessment category is used when breast imaging is performed after a tissue diagnosis of malignancy but prior to definitive local therapy (usually surgery, but this could include other local treatments considered definitive by the multidisciplinary team), and there are no additional or new mammographic abnormalities other than the known cancer that need evaluation. Category 6 is the appropriate assessment prior to definitive local therapy, when providing second opinion review of previously biopsied findings already shown to be malignant, after attempted complete removal of the target lesion by percutaneous core biopsy (but before definitive local therapy), and for the monitoring of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Category 6 should also be used for breast imaging examinations performed after attempted complete surgical excision when the pathology report indicates positive resection margins **and** there is at least one mammographic feature suggestive of residual tumor. The purpose of breast imaging in this situation is not to determine whether re-excision is needed but to indicate the specific location of any area(s) suspicious for a residual tumor that should be included in planned re-excision. If there are no mammographic findings other than those indicating postsurgical change, a benign (BI-RADS category 2) assessment should be rendered, supplemented by a sentence stating that the pathology report indicates positive margins suggesting residual tumor despite the absence of a mammographic correlate.

The use of category 6 is not appropriate for breast imaging examinations performed in surveillance follow-up of prior surgical excision of a malignancy (lumpectomy) when the pathology report indicated no tumor at the margins of resection. If a post-lumpectomy examination demonstrates surgical scarring but no visible malignancy, the appropriate assessment is benign (BI-RADS category 2). If a suspicious finding warranting tissue diagnosis is seen, a BI-RADS category 4 assessment should be given.

Breast imaging is often performed following completion of neoadjuvant systemic treatment prior to definitive local therapy. In this case, a category 6 assessment should be given, even if all mammographic findings of the cancer have resolved, because definitive local therapy (typically surgery) has not been performed. If the post-neoadjuvant therapy imaging study demonstrates a suspicious finding besides the known cancer, then a category 4 or 5

assessment should be rendered. The use of a category 3 (probably benign) assessment is not recommended in individuals with known cancer, as stability cannot be assessed due to ongoing treatment. To allow for complete determination of disease extent prior to treatment and given the higher PPV of additional findings in the situation of a known index cancer, ipsilateral or contralateral findings that might otherwise be assigned a BI-RADS 3 category can be assessed as BI-RADS 4 with a recommendation for biopsy.

For category 6 assessments, the management recommendation "appropriate clinical follow-up with surgeon and/or oncologist" implies surgical excision as eventual management while considering the clinical reality that the timing of excision (when clinically appropriate) will be determined by someone other than the interpreting radiologist. This recommendation does not take into account novel alternative management strategies, like non-surgical treatment or active surveillance of low-risk DCIS [51–53], because these management strategies have not yet been validated.

Note that, as described in the Auditing and Outcomes Monitoring chapter, examinations with a category 6 assessment should not be included in breast imaging audits. Because the diagnosis of malignancy already has been established, inclusion of these cases would skew the data for many performance parameters, confounding the interpretation of audit results.</div>

                <div class="document-content">The biopsy-proven malignancy findings should be fully described.

Additional significant actionable findings should be clearly described as separate from the current cancer and be given appropriate assessments and management recommendations. For category 4 or 5 findings, the management recommendation is tissue diagnosis. Practices may wish to add "if it would impact clinical management" to the tissue diagnosis recommendation, because in patients with breast cancer the need for additional biopsies will depend on the treatment plan. For example, if mastectomy is planned, additional ipsilateral biopsies are not typically warranted.

At minimum, a separate assessment category should be given for each breast MRI examination, according to the highest order actionable BI-RADS assessment category, using the hierarchy of assessments 5 > 4 > 0 > 6 > 3 > 2/1.

Therefore, in patients with current breast cancer, higher order additional actionable findings with assessments of category 0, 4 and 5 supersede category 6 findings, because they warrant immediate action.

It is not required but can be helpful to assign a separate BI-RADS assessment for each finding that is BI-RADS category 3 or higher, to clearly distinguish between multiple findings and their assessment and management.

Abnormal-appearing ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes in the setting of known malignancy should be fully described, but they should not be given a separate BI-RADS assessment. Management of lymphadenopathy often depends on multiple clinical factors and preferences. Abnormal-appearing axillary lymph nodes that are contralateral to a known malignancy with no findings suspicious for malignancy in that breast should be given a BI-RADS assessment based on the level of suspicion for lymph node malignancy.</div>

New to this version of the BI-RADS Manual is a section of FAQs that apply across multiple modalities.

1. Why is it discouraged to use a BI-RADS 0- Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation on MRI screening exams but acceptable for mammography, CEM and ultrasound screening?

The MRI examination should contain all the information needed to make a final assessment and any further recommendations, no matter what the indication for the exam is, in the vast majority of cases. With mammography, CEM and ultrasound, additional evaluation with targeted images may be required before a conclusion can be made, necessitating recall. On rare occasions with MRI, additional imaging, usually with mammography and/or ultrasound, may be needed for further *characterization* of a finding that has a high likelihood of being benign but is not definitively specific. Examples include a probable lymph node that can be more accurately evaluated with ultrasound, or an area of enhancement suspected to be fat necrosis, which may be pathognomonically identified upon mammographic imaging. When using a BI-RADS 0 category in this scenario, the report should specify a contingency plan and assessment if the finding cannot be found or characterized by the additional imaging. A BI-RADS 0 assessment should not be used for a suspicious MRI finding where added imaging is obtained to facilitate biopsy planning.

2. Why should we target the center of a finding instead of its anterior aspect when measuring the distance from the nipple?

Given the increasing use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy before definitive cancer treatment, the size of a finding may change significantly between imaging encounters. Since most cancers that show treatment response decrease in size concentrically, measuring the distance from nipple to the center of the lesion will prove more reproducible. Note that for large findings and those that lie close to the nipple, inclusion of the anterior-posterior size dimension, as well as distance from anterior margin to the nipple, can be useful for surgical planning.

3. We see patients for whom we previously recommended surgical consultation for histology that is considered "high-risk," particularly radial scars. The patient and surgeon decide to follow rather than excise the finding and indicate that any changes on subsequent imaging will dictate management. The follow-up imaging 6 months post-biopsy demonstrates post-biopsy changes (e.g., distortion on mammogram often a little larger than the original area of distortion). What is the appropriate BI-RADS assessment category for an unresected high-risk lesion undergoing imaging follow up?

Institutional and national practices currently vary and will continue to evolve for the management of high-risk lesions. If the biopsy site of the unresected high-risk lesion looks more suspicious, then a BI-RADS category 4 assessment with the recommendation for a repeat biopsy or excision is recommended. If the biopsy site looks stable, or if new findings can be attributed definitively to post-biopsy changes, then a BI-RADS category 2 assessment is appropriate. A sentence can be included indicating that the patient has an unresected high-risk lesion undergoing surveillance to add clarity. Institutions are encouraged to develop a standardized evidence-based approach for the follow up of unexcised high-risk lesions, which can then be communicated to the multidisciplinary team.

4. For patients undergoing non-surgical management of DCIS or invasive cancer (i.e., active surveillance), what is the appropriate BI-RADS assessment category on subsequent imaging? What about patients with cancer who have close or positive margins after surgery who do not undergo further excision?

For patients with known malignancy who have not undergone definitive local therapy, a BI-RADS category 6 is appropriate. This assessment should be used if the cancer is unresected (or

untreated by other means considered definitive by the multidisciplinary team), even if surveillance imaging demonstrates long-term stability or disappearance. If patients have positive or close margins *after* surgery but no suspicious imaging findings, the BI-RADS final assessment should be based on the imaging presentation, so category 2 is appropriate in the case described above if no suspicious imaging findings are present. The differing approach to these two scenarios is based on the idea that in the first case, definitive treatment has not yet taken place. In the second scenario, it has.</div>

                <div class="document-content">- Isn't it internally inconsistent to consider BI-RADS category 3 assessments positive at screening but negative at diagnostic imaging?
  - No, it is internally consistent. The binary management decision at screening involves recommending action before the next interval screening (positive) versus recommending no action until the next interval screening (negative). The management decision pertinent to diagnostic imaging involves recommending tissue diagnosis (positive) versus anything other than tissue diagnosis (negative). Also remember that, as stated previously, BI-RADS category 3 assessments are not recommended for use at screening mammography.
- BI-RADS allows for tracking outcomes of cross-modality studies both at the modality (mammography, ultrasound, MRI) level and the combined level. Does the Manual allow for separate tracking outcomes of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)?
  - Yes. See the benchmarks for DBT above in Table 4.
- 3. We have several mobile mammography units, each accredited as a separate facility. FDA regulations require that each facility has a separate mammography medical outcomes audit. May we combine the mammography medical outcomes audits for these facilities and units?
  - Yes, the FDA has approved an alternative standard [42] allowing mobile unit operators to combine mammography medical outcomes audits under certain conditions. In situations where multiple mobile mammography facilities are under the same ownership, they may be treated collectively as a single facility for the purposes of meeting FDA audit requirements, if all the following conditions are met.

Each facility must consist of a single mobile mammography unit.

- i. The same entity or group administers the operation of all included mobile facilities.
- The same lead interpreting physician has the responsibility for assuring that all included mobile facilities meet FDA requirements.
- iii. The same group of radiologists interprets all images from all included mobile facilities.
- iv. All included mobile facilities provide services to the same patient population.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">BPE is defined as the normal enhancement of glandular elements of the breast. The literature suggests that a majority of women imaged with CEM have minimal or mild background parenchymal enhancement [6,7]. It has yet to be determined whether timing CEM with the stage of the menstrual cycle will affect the accuracy of interpretation. The MRI literature suggests that for MRI, performing the study during a specific stage of the menstrual cycle does not affect sensitivity [8,9].

It can be difficult to differentiate BPE from artifacts that are seen on recombined images. The most common artifact that is appreciated is called rim artifact, also known as breast-within-a-breast, halo artifact, or matrix artifact. This artifact is due to scattered radiation that occurs within the breast during image acquisition. The result is an apparent enhancing halo just deep to the skin surface and can often be seen in the upper breast.

The literature suggests that moderate or marked BPE may be associated with increased risk for malignancy [6]; however, this needs to be studied further before formal associations are made. Studies are also examining whether BPE is related to false negative CEM exams (cancer not identified on CEM) and false positive CEM exams. Until results are available, it is important to remember that CEM is a planar imaging exam, and consequently small benign or malignant abnormalities may blend with BPE when it is moderate or marked. Along these lines, any enhancement that stands out above BPE on CEM should not be dismissed.

The approach for maximizing detection of abnormal enhancement in the setting of increased BPE is similar to that for MRI interpretation. The RC image can be viewed as you might a maximum intensity projection. Look for areas of asymmetric enhancement between the two breasts with special attention to areas separate from the BPE. Correlation with the LE images is critical to determine if an associated morphologic abnormality is present. If none, additional evaluation with targeted ultrasound and possibly MRI would be recommended.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Diagnostic mammography is a tailored imaging study designed to answer a specific question. Multiple specialized views may be obtained at the discretion of the radiologist to gain further information regarding the findings or clinical situation in question. Patients presenting for a diagnostic mammogram include those who have been recalled for additional imaging following a screening examination (to confirm, characterize and localize the potential finding); patients who present with breast symptoms, such as a palpable abnormality, clinically suspicious nipple discharge, focal pain or skin changes; and patients undergoing serial diagnostic imaging to ensure that a finding previously determined to be probably benign is stable in size and appearance over a sufficient follow-up period (e.g., 2 years) to eventually be considered benign. Patients with a personal history of breast cancer may be undergoing post-treatment surveillance using diagnostic mammography, although this is institution specific. However, if, in this latter scenario, only routine mammogram views are obtained, the exam is considered screening for the purpose of the audit.

Although mammography detects breast cancer at an earlier size and stage than physical examination at the population level, *there is no test or group of tests that ensure that an individual does not have breast cancer.* Management decisions following an appropriate diagnostic breast evaluation must incorporate clinical findings, as breast cancer may be mammographically occult, especially for patients with denser breasts. Clinically guided biopsy for a palpable finding following a negative diagnostic work-up may thus be appropriate.

Figure 56 – ABNORMALITY SEEN ON BOTH LOW ENERGY AND RECOMBINED IMAGES: MASS. The low energy (LE) image (A) shows a round, high density, spiculated mass. On the recombined image (RC) (B), the mass shows heterogeneous internal enhancement. When a mass is seen on both the LE and RC images, shape and margin should be described according to the mammography lexicon. It is not necessary to separately describe the shape and margin on the RC image. Internal enhancement and, if desired, conspicuity can be described. Pathology: Invasive ductal carcinoma.</div>

                <div class="document-content">As of this publication, the lexicon used to report findings appreciated on the low energy (LE) and recombined (RC) images of CEM exams are adapted from conventional mammography and breast MRI descriptors. It is important to characterize any abnormality based on both its LE and RC imaging appearance. However, if a mass seen on LE images also enhances, the primary descriptors should be those of the mammography lexicon. It is not necessary to repeat descriptors for the shape and margin of the same mass on the RC images. If appropriate, descriptors for internal enhancement characteristics (homogeneous, heterogeneous, rim) and degree of conspicuity of the enhancement may be described.

If an abnormality has suspicious features on LE but has no RC correlate, it should still be pursued as a suspicious imaging finding. This is particularly true for suspicious calcifications seen on the LE images without corresponding enhancement [1,2]. Similarly, if there is enhancement on recombined images only, without LE correlate, it should be pursued as an indeterminate finding.

Interpreting CEM can be very straightforward when there is a solitary finding seen on both LE and RC images in the setting of minimal background parenchymal enhancement. However, there are circumstances when interpreting the RC images can be challenging. We have outlined some methods for navigating these circumstances below.</div>

                <div class="document-content">he illustrated BI-RADS® v2025 Manual is an extension of the 5th Edition of the BI-RADS Atlas. The v2025 Manual, like its predecessor, includes sections on mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast as well as the auditing and outcomes monitoring section (AOM), formerly referred to as follow-up and outcomes monitoring. The contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) section, previously an Atlas supplement, is now included in the Manual proper.

One immediately obvious difference is the change in overall naming of the BI-RADS project. The switch from "edition" to dated versioning allows for harmonization across all the ACR® RADS programs, which are currently using the versioning nomenclature. Since the BI-RADS project includes a wealth of written information in addition to numerous pictorial examples, the term "manual" rather than "atlas" is felt to be a better descriptor of the breadth of content.

As you will see, the number of examples has been increased significantly throughout all sections of the Manual, and now includes newer technologies (e.g., digital breast tomosynthesis, synthetic mammography, automated whole-breast ultrasound). Also, whenever possible, the authors have placed an emphasis on ensuring consistency in terms and definitions among the four lexicons.

There are several changes and expanded definitions within BI-RADS v2025. Each section preface outlines them in detail. Especially notable are the addition of the new finding type "non-mass lesion" in ultrasound, which will be extremely useful in detecting and describing abnormalities that present as focal asymmetries on mammography and/or non-mass lesions on MRI, and new audit categories (including initial B3 findings and additional MR findings detected on exams performed for extent of disease assessment). Additionally, the concept of method of detection is introduced in the AOM section. Some additions were approached as introductory concepts, with the knowledge that they will likely be included more robustly in future iterations (e.g., the short discussion around the clinical importance of breast arterial calcifications; the idea that surgical excision may not be the only form of "definitive local treatment" available to patients, assessment and quantification of glandular tissue component with ultrasound).

The use of structured clinical indications in report creation is emphasized in BI-RADS v2025. Radiologists are encouraged to use at least the major indication categories and preferably the optional subcategory structured terminology as well. These structured categories should be used for all modalities and will be expected to aid in report clarity, outcomes monitoring and determination of method of cancer detection.

As before, figure legends will designate the defined feature in capital letters. Obviously, many of the illustrations will display several features, for example, "ROUND, circumscribed, high-density mass." Cases will be fully described using lexicon terminology where appropriate; therefore, many of the examples will highlight more than one feature. However, the capitalized terms will indicate the feature that is chosen for illustration. In some cases, several descriptors within a single feature category may be listed (e.g., different forms of calcium) for the purpose of illustration. One must remember that management recommendations should be based on the most worrisome of the features. Thus, while the image legends may include more than one descriptor for any given category (e.g., amorphous and fine pleomorphic calcifications), an actual clinical report would include a statement recommending biopsy due to the presence of fine pleomorphic forms.

When feasible, within any given category, lexicon terminology is presented from least suspicious to most suspicious. While this approach works well for many categories due to strong evidence (e.g., positive predictive value for suspicious calcification morphology and distribution), for other categories the presentation hierarchy is based more on expert consensus. For others still, a hierarchy does not make practical sense (e.g., associated features).

The BI-RADS v2025 Manual is the culmination of a few years of collaborative efforts between the subsection heads and their committees, the ACR, and, importantly, input from users of these lexicons. A diverse group of external reviewers offered valuable and thoughtful commentary, and their suggestions were incorporated when appropriate. The manual is designed for everyday practice and should make it possible to issue unambiguous breast imaging reports and meaningfully evaluate our performance. This will enable us to improve our practices and compare ourselves to other breast imaging facilities worldwide. We all sincerely hope that this document helps breast imagers everywhere better understand and evaluate our subspecialty.

BI-RADS, now more than ever, is intended to be a dynamic and evolving document that will adapt to changes in the practice of breast imaging and be of practical use to radiologists. The move toward an interactive electronic format will allow more frequent updates. As always, the BI-RADS

When there is no associated suspicious enhancement, this finding is benign. The high T1 duct signal is due to blood or protein in the fluid within the ducts. However, if there is coexisting ductal enhancement after contrast administration, other etiologies (e.g., papilloma, DCIS) should be considered.

These structured categories should be used when creating reports for all modalities. Use of structured indications (outlined below) is recommended to aid in achieving report clarity and outcomes monitoring, including method of cancer detection.

A brief but specific description of the indication for examination is provided. This may be screening for an asymptomatic woman undergoing a screening exam. For diagnostic exams,

indications may include recall of a screening-detected finding, evaluation of a clinical finding (specify the finding and its location), or follow-up of a probably benign finding, using the "Diagnostic Work-up" category. If the patient has a current breast cancer not yet definitively treated, the "Diagnostic: Current Cancer" indication can be used. Additional use of the optional sub-categories can provide more information and nuance to the report.

These structured categories should be used when creating reports for all modalities. Use of structured indications (outlined below) is recommended to aid in achieving report clarity and outcomes monitoring, including method of cancer detection (Table 4).

The most common indications for breast US are confirmation and characterization of focal signs/symptoms or abnormalities on other imaging modalities, guidance of interventional procedures, and as the initial imaging technique for young, pregnant, or lactating patients. In asymptomatic women with dense breasts, another indication may be supplemental whole-breast screening. Please see clinical indications in Table below, which are independent of imaging modality. Additional indications are listed in the ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of a Diagnostic Breast Ultrasound Examination [4].

They are typically a benign finding and are commonly seen in patients who are pregnant or lactating. When new, asymmetric, or associated with clinical symptoms or other mammographic abnormalities, further evaluation with diagnostic imaging may be warranted to exclude malignancy [35].

                <div class="document-content">The nipple-areolar complex is quite variable with areola diameter differing widely among patients based in part on patient age and breast size, making the nipple a more reliable landmark than the areola [2]. Normal nipples can be prominent, flat, or inverted. If an abnormality of the nipple is suspected, comparison can be made to the contralateral breast. The nipple's crevices and irregular surface may cause posterior shadowing during ultrasound scanning. A thick layer of gel may provide a medium for clear depiction (Figure 5), but often the tissue behind the nipple and areola are best imaged at an obliquity so as not to image directly through the nipple. The skin of the areola tapers as the areola radiates out from the nipple. The thickness of normal skin over the breast is up to 2 mm except for the region of the areola and inframammary fold, where the skin is normally a little thicker [3].

If there is concern for abnormality, comparison with the contralateral side is helpful in decision making. Nipple is enlarged due to mucinous carcinoma contained within it (B).

**Figure 8** – ANATOMY: NORMAL SKIN COMPLEX. Imaging performed at 18 MHz (A) and 26 MHz (B). Two echogenic lines define a less hyperechoic layer whose total thickness is  $\leq 2$  mm, except in the periareolar region or inframammary fold where it may be thicker. A gel offset enables the upper layer of skin to be seen. The focal zone should be set superficially when evaluating the skin.

Round calcifications are smooth and typically small (< 1 mm) in size. When multiple, they may vary in size and therefore in radiodensity. They frequently form in the acini of lobules and present as multiple similar groups, although diffuse distributions are often seen as well. When bilateral with diffuse or multiple-group distribution, round calcifications can be considered benign. An isolated group of round calcifications on a baseline mammogram or if no prior comparisons are available, and confirmed on magnification views, may warrant a probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) assessment and mammographic surveillance. Image-guided biopsy may be indicated if the round calcifications are new, increasing, linear or segmental in distribution. Biopsy should also be considered if there is a known ipsilateral cancer and stability cannot be confirmed. The term "punctate," historically a subset of round calcifications < 0.5 mm in size, has been removed given the impracticality of measuring the size of minute individual calcifications.

                <div class="document-content">Abscesses typically present with a palpable breast lump associated with pain, swelling, and erythema and are most common during the reproductive years. Puerperal abscesses are related to lactation and non-puerperal abscesses are often associated with smoking, Black race, and medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and steroid treatment. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice as young age and severe pain may preclude mammography. In women over 30 years of age, mammography can also be performed but may be deferred until acute pain and swelling resolve.

Ultrasound features of abscesses include a heterogeneous predominantly hypoechoic mass with posterior enhancement associated with a thick wall, loculation and increased peripheral vascularity, as well as increased echogenicity of surrounding tissue due to parenchymal edema, and skin thickening. In addition to antibiotic treatment, ultrasound-guided aspiration of the abscess fluid may be performed for symptomatic relief and to shorten the duration of illness [66].

Etiologies include arteriovenous malformation (AVM), pseudoaneurysm and superficial thrombophlebitis (Mondor's disease), as well as hemangioma and venous malformations [67]. AVMs are typically congenital or developmental anomalies, whereas pseudoaneurysms are acquired (usually the result of breast trauma and, rarely, the sequelae of image-guided core needle biopsy). Superficial venous thrombophlebitis within the breast typically presents as a palpable cord with or without associated pain [68].

                <div class="document-content">Axillary lymph nodes are usually visible on the MLO view and typically drain the lateral breast and upper extremity.

- a. Normal axillary lymph nodes show circumscribed margins and fatty hila. While a specific cortical thickness threshold has not been defined for mammography, normal axillary nodes generally show uniformly thin (albeit subjectively assessed) cortices. Lymph node length is not an independent determinant of suspicion. Further evaluation with ultrasound is warranted for indeterminate findings.
- b. Abnormal axillary lymph node morphology includes high radiodensity, non-reniform shape, loss of fatty hilum, increased cortical thickness that may be focal, the presence of calcifications, interval enlargement over baseline, or, uncommonly, indistinct margins. They can occur with a variety of benign and malignant etiologies. The 3 mm cortical thickness that may be used with ultrasound as a threshold for suspicion is not validated for mammography.

There has been an increase in visualization of enlarged axillary lymph nodes on mammography related to the COVID-19 or other vaccinations. Auto-immune disorders and infections can also be associated with abnormal lymph nodes. Review of the patient's medical record may reveal a benign cause for adenopathy. Assessing symmetry in relation to the contralateral axilla is an important part of the evaluation, as bilateral adenopathy is more likely to be reactive or inflammatory. However, if an appropriate history to account for adenopathy is not confirmed, diagnostic evaluation may be warranted to rule out underlying malignancy, including non-breast malignancies.

# F. SKIN LESIONS

Skin lesions, including moles, keloids and epidermal inclusion cysts, may be detected on mammography. When visible on the skin surface, they are often marked with a radio-opaque marker by the technologist to avoid confusion with an intramammary mass. Frequently, skin lesions present with a radiolucent halo due to air surrounding the base of the lesion. A skin lesion may be more easily characterizable on DBT due to its location on the first few or last few slices of the imaged breast. Metallic skin markers may cause artifact on DBT. Therefore, some institutions prefer not to mark skin lesions, or non-metallic markers can be used.

                <div class="document-content">The lesion consists of a cluster of anechoic masses, with thin (< 0.5 mm) intervening septations and *no discrete solid* component within any of the locules. The classic criteria suggest each individual cystic space should measure less than 2- to 3-mm. However, one study demonstrated no increase in malignancy when the size criterion was increased to 7 mm [58]. While the conglomerate margin may appear microlobulated due to individual small cysts, the margin should not be indistinct. Tissue diagnoses associated with clustered microcysts include fibrocystic changes and apocrine metaplasia.

Clustered microcysts are common, seen in up to 6% of ultrasound examinations [59]. In a recent review, the outcome of clustered microcysts on breast ultrasound exams has an extremely low rate of malignancy [60]. Microcysts are assessed as benign (BI-RADS assessment category 2), especially when multiple or identified in the context of other fibrocystic changes. However, the presence of an indistinct margin or a discrete solid component should prompt a BI-RADS 4 suspicious assessment, with recommendation for biopsy, particularly if the mass is new or in a post-menopausal patient.

For breast MRI, comparison and correlation to prior beast imaging studies may not be needed for all examinations since the MRI features on the current examination alone are often sufficient for appropriate assessments and recommendations. Comparison is warranted when the radiologist believes evaluating stability or features on other imaging is necessary to fully assess the MRI findings. In particular, for the clinical indication of Diagnostic: Current Breast Cancer, comparison should be made to the prior imaging studies that lead to the cancer diagnosis and/or that last assessed the current cancer whenever possible.

                <div class="document-content">An echogenic rind refers to a thick echogenic band surrounding all or part of a breast mass or non-mass lesion. It disrupts the texture of the normal tissue surrounding the finding and likely represents a desmoplastic reaction or peritumoral edema.

Echogenic rinds can accompany benign and malignant findings, but the presence of this feature has a relatively high predictive value for malignancy [46–48]. An echogenic rind is a suspicious feature unless imaging features confirm the finding is definitively benign (e.g., a mass that clearly contains fat on a mammogram and represents fat necrosis), or the clinical scenario suggests potential infection, hematoma, or fat necrosis. When measuring the size of a mass or non-mass lesion, any associated echogenic rind should be included in the measurement. Studies confirm that including the rind in mass measurements provides the best correlate with the histologic measurement of tumor size [9, 10].

An echogenic rind must be distinguished from an echogenic pseudocapsule because they have essentially opposite implications. An echogenic rind is less sharply demarcated, thicker, and more variable in thickness than a uniformly thin echogenic pseudocapsule. An echogenic rind may be seen around a mass or non-mass lesion of any shape, but an echogenic pseudocapsule, which indicates a high likelihood of a benign mass, will typically only be seen associated with oval or lobulated masses.

**Figure 1** – ASSOCIATED FEATURE: ECHOGENIC RIND. Isoechoic, parallel mass with indistinct margin and a thick ECHOGENIC RIND in the subcutaneous fat. A mass with this combination of features lying in the subcutaneous fat raises the possibility of fat necrosis, and the mammogram should be closely inspected for a fat-containing superficial mass or asymmetry. In this case, fat could not be confirmed in the mass on mammography, and biopsy was performed. Pathology: Fat necrosis.

Figure 2 – ASSOCIATED FEATURE: ECHOGENIC RIND. Ultrasound image (A) demonstrates an oval, hypoechoic indistinct mass with parallel orientation and an associated ECHOGENIC RIND. The morphology and location of the mass in the subcutaneous fat suggests the possibility of fat necrosis. A radiopaque marker was placed over the mass, and a tangential view mammogram (B) confirms a corresponding fat-containing mass (arrows) that is diagnostic of benign fat necrosis. Note that the presence of an echogenic rind indicates the mass margin is non-circumscribed on US.

Additionally, outcomes can be difficult to ascertain, especially when the additional finding is ipsilateral to the known malignancy and image-guided biopsy is not performed prior to definitive local therapy. As an example, practice differences in reporting additional findings not requiring tissue sampling (BI-RADS category 6) vs separate adjacent findings requiring tissue sampling will result in heterogeneity of audit outcomes; clarification in the updated MRI chapter of this version should assist in consistency of this metric.

Linkage of audit data with a regional or organizational tumor registry can provide FN and FP data to calculate sensitivity and specificity and facilitate ROC analysis at the examination level. This is not a helpful strategy in the situation of a findings level audit, however, as the registry data cannot be traced back to the individual findings, and all patients undergoing EOD assessment will be malignant at the registry level. Thus, the ascertainment and calculation of metrics such as FN, FP, Sensitivity, and Specificity can only be performed through diligent internal tracking and correlation with all available data and adequate follow-up through standard intervals. These metrics are less relevant in the setting of a known malignancy and remain optional. The process for collecting the necessary data and calculating the metrics is described below.</div>

FOV refers to the extent of tissue displayed on the monitor. The optimal setting will allow visualization of the skin to the pectoralis major muscle and does not include the pleura or the lung.

The depth displayed should be optimized to allow for the correct characterization of a lesion. Complete tissue inclusion and optimum resolution are needed for accurate interpretation. Excessive zoom and shallow depths can make the margin of the mass appear indistinct. Deep lesions may be missed because they are not included in the tissue image. If the FOV extends too deep, then the ability to detect and characterize superficial or small lesions is significantly reduced. Smaller findings appear significantly reduced in size and cannot be accurately portrayed.

Single suboptimal view of the left breast at 6:00 with tissue of interest (from the skin to the pectoralis muscle) occupying only 50% of the depth of the FOV. From a depth of 2–4 cm, there is no information related to the breast. The focal zones (marked by XX icons) are also set too deep.

The focal zone is set at the cyst; however, the depth of FOV is suboptimal and too deep, including the ribs and pleura, which may cause mischaracterization and misinterpretation of this cyst.

Linear array transducers for breast imaging are typically between 4-5.5 cm in length allowing visualization of that length of breast tissue. Switching the display from rectangular to trapezoidal can improve visualization of larger findings, particularly deeper in the breast.

For larger lesions, there are several methods that can be used to show the entire lesion in one image. Using split screen settings allows visualization of the right and left portions of a large mass or non-mass lesion, thus permitting an approximation of size of the region of interest. Activating split-screen format allows the capture of half of a large lesion or region, followed by activation of the second screen, and image capture of the other half of the lesion. An additional method termed extended field-of-view (EFOV), also known as panoramic view, is more comprehensive and displays the entire length of a lesion in one image and defines the lesion and its relationship with the surrounding tissue. EFOV imaging ensures visualization of far greater tissue than can be imaged with the length of a typical linear array transducer.

A large EFOV can be obtained and is helpful to demonstrate the geographic relationship among multiple lesions or between a lesion and a structure such as the nipple. As with wide FOV automated US, freehand EFOV is also useful for imaging multiple masses as well as large lesions [5]. Such imaging improves global understanding of abnormal findings, particularly in the setting of multiple lesions.

                <div class="document-content">Ultrasound, which can differentiate between the glandular (relatively hypoechoic TDLUs) and stromal (hyperechoic interlobular fibrous tissue) components of the breast, provides a unique set of information regarding breast composition compared to other imaging modalities. In one large-scale longitudinal study, an increase in the observed proportion of glandular tissue (GT) was associated with an inherent future risk of breast cancer comparable to dense breasts on mammography or increased background parenchymal enhancement on contrast-enhanced breast MRI. Lee and colleagues prospectively reviewed 14,767 screening breast ultrasound examinations and stratified the exams based on the percent volume of ductal lobular units in the fibroglandular zone [19, 20]. A qualitatively appraised percent volume of glandular tissue (referred to as the glandular tissue component, or GTC) of < 25% of the overall fibroglandular tissue (FGT) was considered minimal, 25% to 49% as mild, 50% to 74% as moderate, and ≥ 75% as marked glandular tissue component. Patients with a moderate to marked GTC had a higher future risk of developing breast cancer with a hazard ratio of 1.5; p = .03. Additional studies [21, 22] that used this standardized measure and evaluated lobular involution in pathological breast specimens have also demonstrated an increased inherent risk in women with less glandular involution and a moderate to marked degree of glandular tissue component. Breast parenchymal echotexture pattern as well as a qualitative assessment of glandular elements can be reported on screening ultrasound to recognize the potential impact of tissue composition on interpretation and breast cancer risk. This descriptor can be included as a qualifier of fibroglandular background echotexture. See examples below.

                    <strong>저자:</strong> ["ACR Committee on BI-RADS"]<br>

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">No, there is no numeric code for the FDA-approved alternative standard for "Post-Procedure Mammograms for Marker Placement." This assessment may only be used for post-procedure mammograms obtained for the purpose of confirming the deployment and position of breast tissue markers, which typically have been placed at the time of core biopsy. Comparison with pre-biopsy imaging is important to ensure accurate biopsy targeting and sampling. This assessment should be excluded from auditing. Note that there is no FDA-approved equivalent wording for this assessment category other than "Post-Procedure Mammograms for Marker Placement."

Per FDA requirements, mammographic density must be included in the report when marker placement is performed on a different day.

# 3. In my practice we commonly issue addenda and/or comparison reports after initial mammography reports have been issued. What are the FDA requirements for assigning assessment categories?

Following comparison with prior mammograms, a final assessment category for the addendum must be assigned. The report must be communicated to the referring provider. A lay summary of the addendum must be provided to the patient, even if there is no change in the final assessment category or recommended course of action. Amended reports and lay summaries must also include breast density assessment.

# 4. My practice uses the BI-RADS category 4 subdivisions (4A - low suspicion for malignancy, 4B - moderate suspicion for malignancy, 4C - high suspicion for malignancy). May our reports use these subdivisions as assessment categories instead of the category 4 assessment (suspicious)?

No. While you have the option of using one of the three subdivisions of category 4 *in addition to* a final assessment of Suspicious, the FDA will not allow you to use the subcategories instead of the Suspicious assessment category in the mammography report.

# 5. Can screening and diagnostic examinations performed on the same day be combined into one report or must there be two separate reports?

Mammography facilities have the option to issue either separate or combined reports. If two reports are issued (recommended by the ACR), each must contain its own overall final assessment. If facilities decide to issue a single combined report, they need to be aware of the following:

- · A single combined report must contain a single overall final assessment.
- The report should clearly state that it represents the combined results of a screening and diagnostic study.
- It is critical to understand that issuing a single report with a single final assessment will skew the facility's audit results if the overall assessment category is used for both the screening and diagnostic audit calculations. Therefore, it is recommended that separate BI-RADS assessments are generated and recorded for audit purposes. If a breast imaging facility declines this recommendation and continues to generate a combined report with a single overall final assessment, then unique and accurate assessments for the screening and diagnostic examinations should be recorded within the audit data to allow for accurate audit calculations.
- Although some computerized reporting systems may consider this a single examination (rather than two), FDA would still allow the facility to count both examinations toward meeting the continuing experience requirement of the interpreting physician.

# 6. Axillary adenopathy is seen at screening mammography with no suspicious findings in the breasts. What should the BI-RADS final assessment be?

In the absence of a known infectious, reactive, or inflammatory cause, isolated unilateral axillary adenopathy should receive a category 0, with the recommendation for further work-up with ultrasound. At that time, further clinical information may be obtained. Final management would depend on the appearance on diagnostic imaging and the clinical history if available. Of note, unilateral enlarged axillary lymph nodes can be associated with a recent COVID-19 and/or other vaccination when administered in the ipsilateral arm. Review of the patient's medical record may mitigate the need for diagnostic imaging evaluation, in which case the axillary adenopathy can be deemed benign (BI-RADS category 2) if described in the report or negative (BI-RADS category 1) if the radiologist decides not to describe the finding.

Bilateral axillary adenopathy can occur with benign systemic conditions such as autoimmune disease, infection, inflammatory conditions as well as non-breast malignancies such as lymphoma/leukemia. When those histories can be confirmed, axillary adenopathy may be assessed as benign (BI-RADS category 2) if described in the report or negative (BI-RADS category 1) if the radiologist elects not to describe the findings. If no salient clinical history can be identified to account for the adenopathy, recall (BI-RADS 0) for ultrasound imaging and possible biopsy may be indicated, even if adenopathy is bilateral and symmetric. Note that even though lymphoma and leukemia are malignancies, a "known malignancy" assessment (BI-RADS category 6) is not appropriate, since that category is reserved for cancers of breast origin only.

In the case where either unilateral or bilateral axillary adenopathy is determined to be of no clinical significance, a benign rather than negative final assessment may be preferable, so that the etiology of the adenopathy can be communicated in the report to future interpreters.

# 7. For comparison examinations, is it required to include in the report actual dates of the examinations used for comparison or is it acceptable to make a more generalized statement such as "prior breast examinations were compared?"

While not required, it is recommended to include the dates of prior examinations that are used for comparison with the current study in your report, especially if there are findings the radiologist is evaluating for stability or in cases assessing treatment response.

8. Do I need to assign a breast density descriptor to all mammographic exams, even a diagnostic exam with limited views?

BI-RADS requires classification of breast density on every mammography examination that leads to rendering an assessment (0 through 6), as well as when a post-procedure mammogram for clip placement is performed on a day removed from the day of biopsy. In the scenario where only a portion of the tissue is imaged, the best solution may be to repeat the previous breast density (of the bilateral mammogram) in classifying the follow-up examination, to avoid confusion. Additionally, breast density must be included in the lay summary communicated to patients for each of these exam types.

A breast density assessment is required for mammographic evaluation of the male breast and for the ipsilateral post-mastectomy breast even when only that side has been imaged. Additionally, breast density assessment is required for post-procedural examinations performed strictly for marker position verification.

# 9. Is it acceptable to only use a BI-RADS breast composition category letter (A-D) or is the written description required in the report?

No, at minimum the FDA-approved written descriptors of breast density must be used in the report. The BI-RADS density letter designation can be included to improve communication.

10. If the referring provider orders a screening mammogram and indicates that an ultrasound should be performed if needed, which BI-RADS final assessment category is appropriate for the screening examination? Should I assign a category 0 since an ultrasound may be appropriate such as for supplemental screening in patients with dense breasts?

If the screening mammogram is normal or benign, then the BI-RADS final assessment should be category 1 or 2, as appropriate. It is not appropriate to assess a normal screening mammography examination as category 0 even if supplemental screening is recommended. Instead, an additional statement can be included, such as "because of the patient's dense breasts, supplemental screening should be considered."

11. In a patient with silicone breast implants, if the mammogram is negative for malignancy but there is question of implant rupture, is it acceptable to give a BI-RADS category 0 and recommend MRI evaluation to assess implant integrity?

If the mammogram is negative but there is questionable implant rupture, the correct BI-RADS final assessment would be benign category 2: benign, with an additional sentence that recommends a breast MRI to assess implant integrity.

12. What is wrong with assigning a probably benign (category 3) assessment to a group of calcifications I see on a screening exam?

It is only appropriate to assign a probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) assessment following appropriate diagnostic work-up. Immediate diagnostic evaluation may confirm a benign finding (such as layering calcifications) obviating the need for short term follow-up or might identify suspicious features (such as fine pleomorphic calcifications only appreciated with magnification views) that warrant prompt biopsy.

13. Should a post-lumpectomy patient who had the tumor completely excised automatically be assigned a category 3?

A probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) assessment should not be automatically assigned when the patient is undergoing routine surveillance following lumpectomy, even if the facility elects to image at intervals less than one year. Postsurgical changes are expected on mammography and in the absence of suspicious new findings, a benign (category 2) assessment is correct. A category 3 assessment in the post-lumpectomy setting should only be utilized if there are imaging

findings that individually warrant a probably benign designation, such as coarse calcifications at the lumpectomy site that suggest developing fat necrosis.

14. If you see a finding on a mammogram that has convex margins and can be seen on multiple DBT slices but is only seen on one view (e.g., CC or MLO view), can you still call this a mass?

Yes. Because DBT displays findings on multiple consecutive slices, characterization of a mass can be performed even if only identified on one view. Examples of this include low axillary lymph nodes that are only included on the MLO view, or masses that are obscured by surrounding breast tissue on one view but characterized well on the other view.

# **PREFACE**

he BI-RADS v2025 Manual on Ultrasound is an extension of the prior editions. Since the publication of the 5th Edition of BI-RADS (second version for the ultrasound section) in 2013, much has taken place that has solidified the role of ultrasound as indispensable in breast imaging. Breast density reporting laws have now been enacted in most states. The U.S. Congress has passed a federal law mandating the reporting of breast density, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has updated its regulations to require patient notification of breast density. This requirement became effective on September 10, 2024 in all 50 states. With the increasing reporting of breast density (based on mammography), supplemental screening with ultrasound is increasingly practiced. Supplemental ultrasound takes place in different forms around the world – handheld performed by technologist versus physician, or automated breast ultrasound. We took into account both methods when discussing screening ultrasound in this version.

A new element in this version of BI-RADS is the assessment of breast composition at ultrasound. Increasingly, studies are revealing that ultrasound assessment of breast tissues not only may influence detection but also indicate risk. This is particularly significant in practices around the world where ultrasound is being performed as a screening modality (and perhaps even the sole screening modality). Like MRI where there is assessment of degree of enhancement in addition to tissue composition, we are proposing in ultrasound that the both the echotexture pattern and the glandular tissue content may play a clinical role in assessment of risk and in the detection and characterization of breast lesions.

BI-RADS is at its heart a lexicon, and its role as a language remains very much at play. Hence, assessment and fine-tuning of the lesion descriptors is always an important task in updating BI-RADS. In this version, we are introducing (or re-introducing) the term mixed solid and cystic mass, the mass shape of lobulated, and echogenic rind as an associated feature. "Mixed solid and cystic" emphasizes the relative importance of the solid component. In ultrasound, we know that shape is an important consideration in communication, and we feel that having lobulated as a shape in addition to oval, round, and irregular allows for more precise and meaningful communication. Echogenic rind is being used to connote the reaction in the surrounding tissues that may accompany some cancers. The word rind is meant to invoke a sense of import and weight.

Significantly, a new finding category termed non-mass lesion is introduced. With the advances in imaging technology, increasingly nuanced findings are detected, some of which may represent subtle malignancy. We recognize that the non-mass lesion may be a challenging lesion to detect; this is not simply heterogeneous breast tissue but a discrete finding. By creating this category, we hope to expand the utility of ultrasound in diagnosing infiltrative pathologies including lobular and in-situ breast cancers, which may currently elude ultrasound detection. Furthermore, this category may support the clinical implementation of newer modalities such as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), molecular breast imaging (MBI), or CEM, by recognizing non-mass sonographic correlates to imaging findings initially detected on other modalities and thus facilitating biopsy using ultrasound as imaging guidance.

In this Manual, the discussion of lymph nodes has expanded in depth and scope. Nearly all breast cancers spread via the lymphatic system, so the importance of evaluating lymph nodes cannot be over-emphasized. Ultrasound is arguably the most important modality in the evaluation of nodes, especially given its accessibility and utility as a means of biopsy guidance. We describe the spectrum of morphological changes when a node is involved by tumor, along with the anatomy of the various regional nodal basins that constitute nodal staging in the TNM (tumor/node/metastasis) system.

As in prior editions, each image legend describes several features of the imaging finding, with those capitalized signifying the dominant feature being illustrated. Additional descriptors in the legend will be included in lower case (e.g., "ROUND, circumscribed, hypoechoic mass"). Where possible, the biopsy-proven pathology of the finding will be included. Occasionally, multiple descriptors might apply to a finding in the illustration and will be additionally described in the legend. For example, a mass may include both circumscribed and indistinct margination. While more than one descriptor may be included for the purpose of illustration, a single management recommendation should be made based on the most suspicious finding(s) present. As with the mammography and MRI sections, the ultrasound lexicon descriptors within a given category in this BI-RADS Manual are arranged from least to most suspicious, where appropriate.

# INTRODUCTION

argaphic findings expands, the terminology used to describe breast US findings evolves. The importance of ultrasound as a modality for correlation with imaging findings identified at mammography, contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), breast MRI, and other cross-sectional modalities is well-established, along with the use of ultrasound as a guidance method for percutaneous biopsy. It is crucial that an established, standardized lexicon is used for clear, concise, and meaningful reports and to achieve optimal patient care. The descriptive terms and definitions contained in the lexicon have been approved by the ACR Subcommittee on BI-RADS® Ultrasound. The subcommittee based its recommendations on published evidence whenever possible, with the understanding that clinical practices may differ depending on local factors. Additionally, it is certain that the field of breast ultrasound will continue to evolve. Modifications in existing terminology and/or new terminology will be considered as indication arises. If you would like to propose a substantive change, please submit it to the ACR for review by the Committee on BI-RADS, using the contact information mentioned in the preface.

The ACR BI-RADS® — Ultrasound is divided into five sections with an appendix at the end.

                <div class="document-content">CLOCK FACE (Preferred) or Quadrant or Other Anatomic Location

Describe the specific location of the finding

Clock face is preferred as it is the most specific. Clock face should be described in whole hour numbers (e.g., 2 o'clock not 2:30 o'clock). Using smaller "half hour" increments implies a higher level of location precision than is possible across readers and modalities. If findings are between whole hour numbers locations, the closest whole number location should be used. Clock face is oriented based on the patient facing the observer. For example, 3:00 is in the lateral left breast and the medial right breast.

Quadrant can be used instead of clock face when most appropriate, such as for larger findings spanning multiple clock face locations.

Other anatomic locations should be used when they are most appropriate. These are retroareolar (behind the nipple at anterior depth), central (behind the nipple at middle or posterior depth), axillary tail (breast upper outer quadrant adjacent to the axilla), and axilla.

It may be helpful to describe the tissue zone (premammary, mammary, post-mammary) where the finding lies to facilitate lesion identification when correlating among modalities. For example, noting that a mass lies at the subcutaneous pre-mammary zone or at the junction with the mammary tissue zone may allow for more efficient search and more confident identification when ultrasound evaluation is undertaken.</div>

                <div class="document-content">The layered appearance of normal breast anatomy provides landmarks that assist in finding a mass initially identified on other imaging modalities or physical examination. In order from superficial to deep, the layers of the breast include: echogenic skin, isoechoic subcutaneous fat which includes Cooper's ligaments, the echogenic fibroglandular zone, and isoechoic retroglandular fat. All this tissue overlies the isoechoic pectoralis major muscle. When describing the location of a suspected mass, asymmetry or distortion identified on mammography, noting the tissue layer in which the finding is located can be more useful than reporting its apparent depth or precise distance from the nipple estimated on mammographic views while the breast is under compression (Figures 1–4 below). Distance from the nipple may be estimated as anterior, middle, or posterior third of the breast.

**Figure 1** – LOCATION. When reporting the location of a finding identified on mammography or MRI, a radiologist can help the sonographer identify the corresponding structure on ultrasound by describing not only the clock position but also the layer of tissue in which the lesion is located. MLO mammogram (A) shows an oval circumscribed mass in the subcutaneous fat (triangle marker). This location is confirmed on ultrasound (B). Pathology: Reactive intramammary lymph node.

Figure 2 – LOCATION. Mass identified in the left breast on this DBT slice (A) is within the fibroglandular tissue (circled). Corresponding ultrasound image (B) demonstrates an irregular indistinct mass within the fibroglandular zone. Knowledge of the precise tissue layer provides additional confirmation that the

mammographic and sonographic finding are, in fact, the same mass. Pathology: Fibroadenoma.

Figure 3 – LOCATION. Mass identified in the right breast on CC (A) and MLO (B) spot compression views is in the retroglandular fat. (Circle present in both (A) and (B) is a marker on the skin denoting the presence of a mole.) Corresponding ultrasound image (C) demonstrates a non-parallel mass with an echogenic rind in the retroglandular fat (retro). Pathology: Invasive ductal carcinoma.

In addition to the layers themselves, the boundary or interface between layers makes a useful landmark to localize a breast mass (Figure 4).

Figure 4 – LOCATION. Mass (arrow) in the right breast on ML mammogram (A) is located at the interface between the subcutaneous fat and fibroglandular tissue. On the corresponding ultrasound image, the mass is a cluster of microcysts also at the interface between the subcutaneous fat (subQ) and the fibroglandular zone (fgz). Recognizing interfaces between tissue layers can help localize and confirm the location of a mass identified at mammography or MRI.

# **B. IMAGE QUALITY**

The value of ultrasound relies on creating the highest quality images.

Handheld, high-frequency breast ultrasound exams largely depend on operator skill, equipment quality, and optimal configuration of the ultrasound system's image parameters. Poor US image quality can lead to serious misinterpretations such as mistaking a cancer for a cyst.

Optimizing the transducer frequency, field of view (FOV), dynamic range, gain, and focal zone settings can correctly differentiate benign from suspicious findings and improve diagnostic accuracy. Doppler settings are also useful to determine the presence of blood flow; any mass within which blood flow can be demonstrated is not a cyst. However, care must be taken to scan without too much compression that may reduce or prevent detection of slow vascular flow in the breast. Compression may even make vascular masses appear avascular.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Morphologically abnormal axillary lymph nodes may warrant comment, clinical correlation, and additional evaluation, especially if they are new or considerably larger or rounder when compared to a previous examination. There is no upper limit of size for an axillary lymph node with normal morphology. The larger the lymph node, the thinner the hypoechoic cortex should appear relative to the overall size of the node, and central echogenic hilar fat should be seen. At the same time, even when a lymph node is not enlarged, the compression, displacement, or absence of fatty hilum suggests pathology, as do cortical morphological abnormalities and marked hypoechogenicity. However, there is no specific sonographic feature that reliably distinguishes a nodal metastasis from a benign reactive node. Because of individual variability in the size and number of axillary lymph nodes, assessment of side-to-side symmetry between the right and left axillae is often helpful.

Figure 5 – LYMPH NODES – AXILLARY, ABNORMAL. Bilateral MLO mammograms (A) show an abnormal node in the left axilla (arrow). While it maintains an oval reniform shape with some retained fatty hilum, it is enlarged with a thickened cortex and appears different from the other nodes. The mammogram examination is otherwise negative, and the patient is asymptomatic. Corresponding longitudinal US (B) image of the abnormal node show that despite the maintenance of the oval reniform shape, the echogenic hilum (arrow) is compressed and displaced, and the hypoechoic cortex is uniformly thickened (> 10 mm). Doppler US image in the transverse plane (C) shows increased vascularity in the cortex of the abnormal node. US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy image (D) shows the echogenic needle sampling the cortex. Cytological evaluation revealed polytypic lymphoid population, favoring a reactive process (such as connective tissue or autoimmune disorder). Imaging and clinical stability 2 years later (without evidence of malignancy) support the non-malignant diagnosis.

Longitudinal (B) and transverse (C) US images of one of the palpable axillary nodes. This is a malignant node. There is near complete obliteration of the fatty hilum. The margin is non-circumscribed; the indistinctness of the margin suggests extranodal extension, which was confirmed at surgery.

Note the mild diffuse cortical thickening of 5 mm with preservation of the fatty hilum. There were multiple other nodes in the left axilla with similar cortical thickening, as expected for reactive adenopathy.

In staging breast cancer, regional (not metastatic or stage 4) nodal disease includes tumor spread to the ipsilateral axilla, internal mammary chain, or supraclavicular space. These are termed regional nodal basins. Any metastases to the contralateral nodal basins would be stage 4 metastatic disease. Ultrasound of the nodal regions may be performed to effectively determine the N stage [1, 70, 73, 74].

From the surgical perspective, the axilla is divided into three levels: I, II, and III. The pectoralis minor muscle serves as the landmark, with the following definitions:

- a. Level I: lateral to the lateral margin of the pectoralis minor muscle.
- b. Level II: posterior to the pectoralis minor muscle, or between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles (also known as interpectoral node or Rotter's node); to guide surgical excision, an abnormal interpectoral node (i.e. Rotter's node) should be specified as such rather than generically referred to as a level II node.
- c. Level III: medial to the medial margin of the pectoralis minor muscle.

As a result, the mass margin should typically be characterized on DBT slice images, when available, rather than on the DM images.

The margin descriptor "microlobulated" (many small undulations) has been removed from the mammography lexicon. Lobulated shape was felt, based on some data as well as expert consensus, to convey a more suspicious appearance compared to a strictly oval shape and was therefore returned to the lexicon to allow a more nuanced shape description. Microlobulated margin was removed to avoid overlapping terminology between shape and margin. A microlobulated margin should now be described as indistinct.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Microcalcifications appear as tiny echogenic foci on US and are most conspicuous when located within a hypoechoic mass, non-mass lesion, or duct [38]. Because of their small size, microcalcifications are typically not associated with posterior shadowing and usually blend in with surrounding fibroglandular tissue, unless occurring within a large group. Posterior shadowing may be present if the microcalcifications are tightly grouped and thus attenuate the US beam. Echogenic Cooper's ligaments seen in cross section can have the appearance of tiny echogenic foci and are a source of artifact that can mimic microcalcifications.

Solitary dilated ducts are a rare finding at both screening and diagnostic mammography. A solitary dilated duct may be the mammographic presentation for a patient with nipple discharge.

Limited data report that malignancy rates of a solitary dilated duct without other associated clinical or imaging findings are low [36–38]. While the 5th Edition indicated that this finding should be considered a BI-RADS 4A finding, more recent publications suggest that the malignancy rate is sufficiently low to consider a benign assessment if there are no associated clinical or additional imaging findings or change over time. At baseline, or when new or associated with clinical or other mammographic abnormalities, further evaluation with diagnostic imaging may be warranted to exclude malignancy [35, 39].

Contrast enhanced exams should include the dose and type of gadolinium contrast agent and the details of contrast injection. Temporal resolution (including any delay after contrast administration, number and length of post-contrast sequences) should be reported for dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) series. When utilized, CAE of kinetics or other post-processing techniques should also be described. Since most parameters will remain constant, standardized language for MRI techniques can be used in the reports. Finally, significant imaging artifacts such as from patient motion, susceptibility artifacts, fat suppression failure/inhomogeneity, and suboptimal contrast injection should be described.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Architectural distortion is seen as thin lines radiating from a point and/or focal retraction or straightening of the breast parenchyma, representing distortion of tissue planes. It may be associated with a mass or non-mass lesion. Architectural distortion is commonly a sequela of postsurgical scarring, or it may represent a radial scar, increasingly detected with DBT. At the same time, architectural distortion may be the imaging manifestation of the desmoplastic reaction of a cancer.

Automated US, whole breast coronal reconstruction (A), shows crosshairs defining small isoechoic mass at 11:00 in the left breast with ARCHITECTURAL DISTORTION. (B) Top image is from the volumetric acquisition (transverse), crosshairs correlating the small mass with its appearance on the other views, coronal on lower left and sagittal on lower right image, to provide 3D depiction. Tissue composition is fatty, and the artifact or defect at the upper right edge of the coronal view is due to lack of contact of the transducer with the skin. Pathology: Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2. Note incidental nearby cysts.

                <div class="document-content">These are cysts that contain debris, without a discrete solid component, and have a thin wall. Often the debris manifests as diffuse, homogeneous low-level echoes. Sometimes the debris may have a layered appearance that can shift slowly with changes in the patient's position or appear as diffuse mobile scintillating reflectors. Complicated cysts are benign.

**Note:** The presence of a discrete solid component (including a solid mural nodule) should cause what otherwise might be considered a complicated cyst to be described as a mixed solid and cystic mass.

Figure 1 – SPECIAL CASES: COMPLICATED CYST. A woman presented with a palpable mass just lateral to the nipple. This COMPLICATED CYST meets nearly all the sonographic criteria that define a simple cyst but contains diffuse low-level internal echoes (A) and shows visible rim vascularity (B). The wall is thick and isoechoic, indicating acute inflammation, unlike the thin echogenic walls of non-inflamed cysts. However, its inward border is smooth. A large vessel parallel to the pericystic thickening is characteristic of an inflamed cyst. Also note the artifactual color signal within the complicated cyst correlating to movement of the internal echoes (B). The cyst contents may shift due to the ultrasound beam's imparted acoustic energy, resulting in scintillating echoes, often intensified by applying Doppler.

                <div class="document-content">Density is used to define the x-ray attenuation of a mass relative to the expected attenuation of an equal volume of normal fibroglandular tissue. Most breast cancers that present as a mass are of equal or higher density than an equal volume of normal fibroglandular tissue. The likelihood of malignancy for a high density mass (70%) is significantly greater than that for equal- and low-density masses (22%) [16]. It is rare — although not impossible — for breast cancer to be low density. Mass density is a subjective evaluation that is the least reliable of the mammographic mass descriptors (i.e., compared to shape and margin).</div>

                <div class="document-content">Describe the location based on depth (anterior, middle, posterior) or distance from the nipple in whole centimeters (e.g., 2 cm from the nipple, not 2.3 cm from the nipple). Using smaller distance increments implies a higher level of precision than is possible across readers and modalities. If findings are between whole cm locations, the closest whole cm location should be selected and used.

The distance from the nipple is measured from the base of the nipple to the center of the finding. If the finding is close to the nipple, it is important to describe how far the anterior extent of the imaging finding is from the nipple to assist with surgical planning. If the finding is large, distance to its anterior and posterior extents can also be included, to assist with surgical planning. If the findings are close to the skin, pectoralis muscle or chest wall, describe the distance of the findings to these structures. Due to differences in patient positioning and other technique factors, distance from the nipple, skin, pectoralis muscle and chest wall may vary across modalities.

It may be helpful to describe the anatomic zone where the finding lies to facilitate lesion identification when correlating among modalities. For example, noting that a mass lies at the subcutaneous fat-fibroglandular zone junction may allow for more efficient search and more confident identification when ultrasound evaluation is undertaken.

# IV. EXAMPLES OF HOW TO CLASSIFY EXAMINATIONS AS TRUE-POSITIVE, TRUE-NEGATIVE, FALSE-POSITIVE, AND FALSE-NEGATIVE

Remember, at screening examination BI-RADS categories 0, 3, 4, and 5 are positive assessments, whereas BI-RADS categories 1 and 2 are negative assessments. When online interpretation is made for screening mammography or screening breast US and additional image(s), above and beyond the standard screening protocol, are acquired and permanently archived, a diagnostic examination is created and the screening component of the examination is audited as positive (the same as recall for additional imaging, BI-RADS category 0), whether or not separate screening and diagnostic reports are issued. The rationale behind these definitions of positive and negative is that the interpretation of screening examinations involves the binary decision of recommending acquisition and permanently archiving additional imaging beyond the screening protocol prior to next interval screening (positive) versus recommending no additional action until next interval screening (negative). At diagnostic examination, BI-RADS categories 4 and 5 are positive assessments, whereas BI-RADS categories 1, 2, and 3 are negative assessments, based on the definition that a positive diagnostic examination is one for which tissue diagnosis is recommended. True or false outcomes depend on whether there is a tissue diagnosis of breast cancer within the standard ascertainment interval of the breast imaging examination. The ascertainment interval for asymptomatic patients recalled from screening begins with the date of the screening examination. The ascertainment interval for patients presenting with clinical signs or symptoms, after a previously negative screening examination, begins with the new diagnostic examination.</div>

                <div class="document-content">To obtain an accurate characterization of normal and abnormal findings, the placement of the focal zone(s) in the anterior-to-middle third of the region of interest between the skin and chest wall improves the depiction and resolution of adjacent objects at similar depth. The discrimination of a lesion is best when the focal zone is positioned at the center of the lesion. Two to three focal zones or a single focal zone that has variable range will increase the resolution of the tissue imaged within that zone. However, in many systems, if more than three focal zones are used, the frame rate will be slowed significantly, making real-time scanning prohibitive. Modern systems have transducers that can be used with broad focal zone ranges that facilitate the rapidity of scanning large areas of the breast. If a targeted scan (focused on one specific finding) is being done, a single zone or narrow range can be set at the midlevel of the mass or area of interest. Artifacts and blur caused by poor placement of the focal zones can cause misinterpretation of breast lesions.

Figure 1 – IMAGE QUALITY: FOCAL ZONE. Focal zone (marked XX icons) inappropriately positioned below the mass causing echoes to appear within its anterior half (A); with focal zone set properly in the midportion of the mass (B), its anechogenicity is unquestioned.

Figure 3 – IMAGE QUALITY: FOCAL ZONE. Focal zone placement can affect conspicuity and clarity of lesion depiction. Two US images of a carcinoma that was readily visible at mammography (not shown) were obtained with focal zone settings (marked by a pair of XX icons) at different levels. Although the small invasive ductal carcinoma is clearly identifiable on both images, marginal features are best depicted when the focal zones are set at the depth of the lesion (A). When the focal zones are set at the posterior aspect of the lesion (B) marginal features are less distinct.

Gray scale trapezoidal images demonstrate a 3.8 cm mixed solid and cystic mass at the left 3:00 periareolar region. The same mass is depicted in both images; however, the focal zone is positioned correctly in the center of the lesion in (A) and inappropriately focused 10 cm deep in the tissue in (B).

While not currently the standard-of-care, US-guided biopsy using fine-needle aspiration technique may be performed [75]. Alternatively, adjunctive imaging modalities including MRI and PET-CT have been reported to be sensitive for the detection of tumor involvement [1].

                <div class="document-content">In the current version, among the descriptors of typically benign calcifications, the term "popcorn like" has been eliminated by incorporating it into the remaining term "coarse" to simplify reporting, and in keeping with the radiology-wide move away from using food-related descriptors. This category also now includes dystrophic calcifications as well, which has been eliminated as a separate category.

The term "milk of calcium" has been replaced by "layering" to emphasize the morphologic appearance of underlying process (i.e., layering or sedimentation of calcium within micro- or macro-cysts) rather than the physiologic make-up of the sediment.

The term "punctate" has also been removed, since both "round" and "punctate" referred to particles that are round in shape. Historically, round calcifications were termed punctate when < 0.5 mm and round when > 0.5 mm. In the 5th Edition, punctate became a subcategory of round calcifications. However, given the impracticality of measuring the size of individual calcifications, "punctate" has been removed as a descriptor. Any calcification with a round shape should be characterized as "round," regardless of size.</div>

                <div class="document-content">At US, calcifications situated in fat or fibroglandular tissue are less conspicuous than when present within a mass or within a non-mass lesion. Small echogenic foci grouped in tissue may sometimes be identified because they have patterns different from those of acoustic speckle and transversely sectioned Cooper's ligaments or pectoral muscle fascicles. Because they occupy too small a portion of the acoustic beam, individual calcifications that are not coarse will not shadow. If calcifications are sufficiently numerous for a pattern to be discerned, they may be perceived as grouped in the area of tissue being examined with US. It is possible that calcifications outside of a mass reside within a non-mass lesion. Because non-mass lesion is a new BI-RADS descriptor, more investigation is needed to determine whether calcifications outside of a mass are always associated with a non-mass lesion on US.

Hyperechoic masses have increased echogenicity relative to fat, often equal to fibro-glandular tissue. Although many hyperechoic masses such as fat necrosis, hemangio-mas, and some lipomas are benign, hyperechoic echo pattern alone is not sufficient to assign a benign assessment. To be assessed as BI-RADS 2, benign based on its hyper-echoic echo pattern, a mass must also be located in the subcutaneous fat, must be uniformly hyperechoic with no hypoechoic or anechoic portion, and must be oval in shape with circumscribed margin, parallel orientation, and no posterior shadowing. A hyper-echoic mass that is clearly associated with a fat-containing mass at mammography can also be presumed benign; however, a hyperechoic mass on ultrasound associated with a soft tissue density mass on mammogram is suspicious [23–26].

                <div class="document-content">Grayscale gain is used to compensate for beam attenuation in deeper tissue. US waves are absorbed by tissue; the deeper the tissue, the greater the absorption that has occurred, with less of the beam available to create an image. Increasing the gain may help compensate for this by increasing the brightness of the image, but penetration of tissue for adequate depiction also depends on transducer frequency (greater penetration inversely proportional to frequency), focal zone settings, power increase, and the appropriate selection of FOV. Gray scale gain should be set so normal breast parenchyma varies in echogenicity using much of the gray scale range. The gain may be set too high if the tissue appears as varying shades of white, which can obscure some lesions and make some cysts appear solid. The gain may be set too low if the fat appears dark gray to black, causing some very hypoechoic solid lesions to appear anechoic and be mistaken for simple cysts. As a reference setting for the gray scale, subcutaneous fat lobules should appear medium gray, never black.

![](images/_page_29_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 1** – IMAGE QUALITY: GRAY SCALE GAIN. A simple cyst is optimally imaged with appropriate gain and focal zone setting. The center of the cyst appears anechoic, and distinct from the surrounding fat and parenchyma recognized due to the different shades of gray in this well-modulated image. The focal zone is positioned in the middle one third of the anechoic cyst allowing proper interpretation. Reverberation artifact (arrow) is identified along the anterior wall of the anechoic cyst.

**Figure 2** – IMAGE QUALITY: GRAY SCALE GAIN. Two patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. In (A) there is an inappropriately low setting of the gain making this triple negative breast cancer appear more anechoic than in image (B). Fat should appear gray as in image (B).

                <div class="document-content">With non-mass lesions, there is no requirement for a correlate on another imaging modality. While it is known that the probability of malignancy increases for a non-mass lesion at ultrasound when there is a correlate on another imaging modality, the precise answer to this question is unknown currently. The BI-RADS lexicon serves as a tool for data collection in furthering our understanding of imaging findings and determining their clinical significance. It is hoped that with the introduction of the category of non-mass lesion in the BI-RADS ultrasound lexicon, data may be collected to derive management guidance and improve patient care.

# Can screening US be assessed as BI-RADS 3?

Similar to screening mammography, the assessment of BI-RADS 3 is discouraged based only on screening ultrasound images. With prompt and thorough diagnostic imaging evaluation of potentially abnormal findings detected at screening ultrasound, which may include additional ultrasound images (beyond those obtained at screening ultrasound) as well as correlation with both screening and/or diagnostic mammography, subtle cancers may be identified instead of being mistakenly assessed as probably benign. Similarly, immediate diagnostic evaluation (rather than delayed evaluation at 6 months due to a BI-RADS 3 being rendered directly from screening) may reveal definitively benign features such as fat within a lesion, precluding the need for unnecessary follow-up.</div>

T2 signal intensity does not need to be reported for masses that are definitively benign or suspicious based on their morphology features.

T2 intensity should be categorized as hyperintense, or not hyperintense. The signal intensity should be assessed subjectively, using a normal lymph node as an internal standard.

a. Hyperintense — the mass is uniformly bright throughout and "lymph node bright," i.e. as bright as a normal-appearing axillary or intramammary lymph node.

The US descriptors for tissue composition are subdivided into tissue pattern and glandular tissue component. The three descriptors for tissue pattern are "homogeneous background echotexture-fat," "homogeneous background echotexture-fibroglandular," and "heterogeneous background echotexture" (Table 5). These descriptors correspond loosely to the four density descriptors of mammography and the four fibroglandular tissue descriptors of MRI. Tissue composition is further characterized by glandular tissue component. The amount of glandular tissue compared to stromal tissue is categorized as minimal, mild, moderate, and marked. Please see Section II.A. in this BI-RADS Ultrasound section for further discussion of tissue composition.

                <div class="document-content">Compound imaging reduces noise (speckle) by averaging ultrasound information obtained from numerous angles into one composite image. Electronic steering of the ultrasound beam along many angles improves visualization of a mass margin and its relationship with the adjacent surrounding tissue. The process can be repeated so rapidly that imaging occurs in real time, but the frame rate will slow as an increasing number of overlapping images is selected [6]. Given the improvement in image quality with compound imaging, architectural alterations may be easier to appreciate.

When masses are centered in an image obtained with spatial compounding, the margin is more confidently interpreted [7]. However, posterior acoustic features such as shadowing and enhancement may be suppressed with spatial compounding, and enhancement may appear conical, reflecting the pattern of intersecting beam angles.

Posterior enhancement is triangular or conical in image (B), with compound imaging. Since compound imaging produces an image from several overlapping ultrasound images each obtained with the beam angled differently, artifacts due to inherent noise (i.e., speckle artifact) seen in image (A) are reduced and real reflectors are clarified with its use, as seen in image (B).

                <div class="document-content">A focal asymmetry is an area of tissue that is confined to less than one quadrant and asymmetric to the corresponding location in the contralateral breast. It is visible and may appear similar on multiple mammographic projections (hence, a real finding rather than superimposition of normal breast structures) but lacks the convex contour, central density and the conspicuity of a mass. The contour of a focal asymmetry is concave and there is usually interspersed fat.

New to this version, the term "developing asymmetry" as a descriptor has been discontinued, to be consistent with the remaining lexicon, where delineation of change over time is not embedded in the descriptor terminology. Additionally, the term was on occasion not fully descriptive, as it was intended to describe a new, larger or more conspicuous *focal* asymmetry, but only contained the term "asymmetry." Now such findings can be described as focal asymmetries and, if desired, change in appearance over time can be commented upon.

Although terminology has changed, the clinical importance of a new or increasingly conspicuous asymmetry or focal asymmetry should be strongly stressed. If confirmed to be a real finding on diagnostic evaluation, biopsy should be recommended even in the absence of an ultrasound correlate, as the positive predictive value for such a finding is in the range of 7.4–12.8% when detected on screening and 19.7–26.7% in the diagnostic setting [31, 32].</div>

                <div class="document-content">Similar to screening mammography, the assessment of BI-RADS 4 or 5 is discouraged at screening ultrasound. Diagnostic imaging (ultrasound and mammography) may reveal additional lesions for biopsy planning and better define extent of disease.

# 7. Should we be assessing the level of axillary nodes on US and is it even possible/accurate to assess level II and III nodes on US?

In the current (8th) edition of the AJCC Breast Cancer Staging Manual, regional nodal staging considers lymph node(s) at all three levels of the axilla, the internal mammary chain, and the supraclavicular space. The use of ultrasound to assess level I versus level II versus level III axillary nodes has been described in the published literature and routinely practiced in some facilities. Whether or not any one facility should be using ultrasound for such assessment depends on various factors: 1) level of experience and expertise in using ultrasound for such assessment; 2) if and how such information contributes to clinical care of the patient at any particular facility; 3) whether and how accessible is MRI for regional nodal staging at any particular facility.

# 8. Should we be imaging the internal mammary nodal basin or the supraclavicular nodal basin using US when we are staging breast cancer?

This information is part of breast cancer staging. Whether or not any one facility should be using ultrasound for such assessment depends on various factors: 1) level of experience and expertise in using ultrasound for such assessment; 2) if and how such information contributes to clinical care of the patient at any particular facility; 3) whether and how accessible is MRI for regional nodal staging at any particular facility. Of note, breast MRI often does not include the supraclavicular region in its field of view (FOV), so ultrasound is considered the modality of choice in imaging the supraclavicular nodal basin.

# 9. A patient presents with a palpable lump for 1 year, with clinical and imaging features consistent with a chronic abscess. What is the BI-RADS assessment?

Given that the imaging features are consistent with a chronic abscess, this may be assessed as BI-RADS 2, benign. Even in the setting of a BI-RADS 2 assessment, ultrasound-guided aspiration may be performed for symptomatic indications and/or microbiological evaluation (e.g. culture and sensitivities). The imaging assessment and the management recommendation are uncoupled from each other.

# 10. If the chronic abscess in the scenario above cannot be aspirated, and I proceed to perform a core biopsy followed by referral to a clinician for antibiotics, what is the BI-RADS assessment?

The BI-RADS assessment remains BI-RADS 2 benign, based on the imaging features. However, if there is any consideration that the finding may be cancer rather than chronic abscess or granulomatous mastitis, then BI-RADS 4 suspicious assessment should be rendered.

# 11. If a patient has a BI-RADS 3 finding, identified only on screening or targeted US, and undergoing 6-, 12- and 24-month ultrasound surveillance, when her next routine mammogram is due, should it be a screening or diagnostic mammogram?

The answer to this question depends on the workflow of the particular facility. For patient convenience, it is recommended that ultrasound and mammography be performed on the same day. Whether that mammography is best scheduled as a screening versus a diagnostic examination depends on the particular facility.

# 12. If a benign finding (e.g. simple cyst) is identified on screening ultrasound, what is the appropriate BI-RADS assessment?

There are two potential scenarios in this question.

If no additional images beyond the standard screening images are captured, then the radiologist may either interpret this study as BI-RADS 1 negative (and not mention the simple cyst) or BI-RADS 2 benign (and describe the simple cyst in the report). Each center may decide for itself what constitutes "standard screening images." These will include those prescribed in the ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of a Diagnostic Breast Ultrasound Examination but might also include pertinent benign findings which the operator wishes to document, such as a cyst with a mammogram correlate or a stable benign solid mass. Please note, these additional images cannot include findings that require further immediate action or recall. If those images were included, the exam would, by definition, become a BI-RADS 0 assessment.

If additional imaging is required for a finding and it is performed in the same setting and shown to be benign, then the radiologist should interpret this overall study as BI-RADS 2, benign. For purpose of audit, however, the radiologist should count this as two separate exams: BI-RADS 0 incomplete: needs additional imaging for the screening component and BI-RADS 2 benign for the diagnostic component (i.e. the additional images beyond the usual screening images).

# 13. Is it appropriate to assess an US finding as BI-RADS 0 if an MRI or CEM exam is recommended for problem-solving?

Using a BI-RADS 0 assessment on an ultrasound exam in order to recommend MRI, CEM or mammography in the setting of "problem-solving" should be used only in rare circumstances and only if there is high likelihood that the finding is benign and that added imaging will confirm such, thereby negating the need for biopsy or surveillance follow-up. An example might be probable fat necrosis whose etiology could be readily confirmed upon correlation with mammography. If this approach is used, contingency management recommendations (should the finding not be fully characterized with added imaging) should be specifically outlined in the US report (e.g., if mammographic findings characteristic of fat necrosis are not identified as a correlate for this US finding, ultrasound-guided biopsy should be performed). If the original US finding is potentially or substantially suspicious for cancer on ultrasound, added imaging should not routinely be recommended and the finding should undergo "up-front" biopsy.

# 14. Does an abscess undergoing antibiotic treatment require follow-up ultrasound imaging to resolution? If so, would this be assessed as BI-RADS 3 or BI-RADS 2?

The answer depends on whether the imaging findings are classic for an abscess versus likely representing an abscess. If the former, then the finding would be assessed as BI-RADS 2 benign, with no need for follow-up ultrasound. If the latter, then the finding would be assessed as BI-RADS 3 probably benign, with recommendation for follow-up ultrasound.

# 15. If a probably benign sonographic mass is identified (i.e. oval hypoechoic mass with circumscribed margin and parallel orientation), but the patient requests biopsy rather than short-term interval ultrasound, would this be assessed as BI-RADS 3 or BI-RADS 4A?

This mass should be assessed as BI-RADS 3 probably benign, with recommendation for biopsy based on patient preference. This is an example where the imaging assessment and the management recommendation are uncoupled.

# 16. MRI reveals a BI-RADS 4 suspicious finding, for which "second-look" or "MRI-directed" ultrasound is recommended for imaging guided biopsy. If no sonographic is identified (i.e. MRI-directed

# ultrasound is normal), should be the ultrasound be assessed as BI-RADS 4 suspicious or BI-RADS 1 negative?

In this scenario, the "second-look" or "MRI-directed" ultrasound should be assessed as BI-RADS 1 negative, with management recommendation for MRI-guided biopsy. This is an example where the imaging assessment and the management recommendation are uncoupled. In the optimal setting, the MR report would have outlined specific contingency management (e.g. if MR-directed US is negative, MR-guided biopsy should be performed). Note that the term "second-look" ultrasound should be avoided as it implies that a "first-look" ultrasound has been performed. The terms "targeted", "MRI-targeted", "directed", or "MRI-directed" ultrasound should be used.

                <div class="document-content">In the current version, more flexibility is permitted in lesion location description. Delineation of quadrant and/or clock face is acceptable, as is either depth (anterior, mid or posterior) or distance from the nipple. Note that in this version, depth on MLO view is determined by using imaginary divisions that parallel the angle of the pectoralis major muscle. This method is felt to be more anatomically logical. In this way, findings that project over axilla will always be considered at posterior depth, rather than occasionally at middle depth, as could occur using the prior system of depth assignment. This facilitates correlation between mammography and other breast imaging modalities, given differences in patient positioning.

# 7. COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS EXAMINATIONS

Comparison to prior exams should occur when the patient has images within the system; retrieval of outside images for comparison is encouraged when logistically feasible. When suspicious findings are present, comparison with previous examination(s) can be useful, but biopsy should not be delayed awaiting arrival of prior exams. For findings that clearly require

prompt action, comments about the presence or absence of interval change may be omitted. Comparison to prior exams remains essential before assigning a BI-RADS 3 assessment. This will allow stable findings to be appropriately dismissed as benign and prompt biopsy rather than surveillance for findings whose change over time confirms suspicion.</div>

                <div class="document-content">New to this version of the BI-RADS Manual are suggested structured categories for the major clinical indications used for breast imaging, with associated optional subcategories and relevant clinical histories (see below). Use of these structured categories is strongly encouraged but not required in reporting across all modalities. Use of these structured indications has many benefits, including facilitating auditing of outcomes according to the different major indication categories of screening versus non-screening examinations, which have different performance outcomes. Use of these categories will also greatly assist in determining the method of cancer detection, as described more fully in the Auditing and Outcomes Monitoring section of the Manual.</div>

Edema is often accompanied by skin thickening. It is helpful to distinguish edema as unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral edema suggests a focal process, such as inflammatory breast cancer, mastitis, or post-radiation therapy changes. Bilateral edema suggests a systemic disorder, such as congestive heart failure, renal failure, or central venous obstruction.

                <div class="document-content">Although not as sensitive as MRI, US can detect intracapsular and extracapsular silicone rupture with a reported sensitivity of 30-75% [61]. Imaging is not necessary to assess saline implant integrity, as this is a clinical assessment. Both silicone and saline within normal implants will appear anechoic with a curvilinear echogenic capsule. The normal implant shell manifests as two parallel echogenic lines on US.

Intracapsular rupture of a silicone implant may have a "stepladder" appearance when multiple layers of the shell are collapsed anteriorly. Extracapsular silicone associated with a ruptured implant will have a characteristic "snowstorm" appearance [61]. This is related to echogenic noise artifact which obscures the posterior tissue. If large enough, extravasated silicone may also appear as an anechoic mass similar to the silicone within the implant. Extravasated free silicone or silicone gel bleed may travel through lymphatics and deposit in lymph nodes, which then exhibit similar imaging characteristics.

Fluid collections around silicone implants should be evaluated carefully. While small perimplant fluid collections are usually insignificant, large or increasing peri-implant fluid may indicate the rare presence of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a recently recognized non-Hodgkin lymphoma of T-cell origin, most often associated with textured breast implants [62]. Patients with BIA-ALCL typically present with breast swelling, asymmetry or pain occurring more than one year after implant placement [62]. Ultrasound is the first line imaging modality of choice and may show a large or increasing peri-implant fluid collection, and an associated mass may be present [63]. The specificity of ultrasound is low, as peri-implant fluid collections may be related to more common benign entities such as inflammation, infection or implant rupture. Diagnosis can be made by large volume US-guided aspiration with cytologic and microbiological evaluation of the peri-implant effusion, as well as biopsy of any associated mass [63]. At least 10-50 ml of fluid is necessary and should be specifically tested with flow cytometry, CD30 and other lineage-associated markers to evaluate for BIA-ALCL [64].

                <div class="document-content">It has been shown that MRI has a higher sensitivity for detection of breast cancer but lower or comparable specificity than CEM. MRI also offers better visualization of areas typically not well seen on mammography including far posterior locations or axilla. MRI is more expensive than CEM, not always covered by insurance, and not as easily tolerated for most women. MRI is recommended for very high-risk patients (such as BRCA mutation carriers, lifetime risk of  $\geq$  20%). CEM may be used as supplemental screening for women at intermediate risk for breast cancer (lifetime risk of 15–20%). Currently, CEM is not approved by the FDA for screening so using this examination for this indication would be considered an off-label use. Facilities that choose to

use CEM for screening are encouraged to have strict criteria for who will be screened and carefully audit their results.</div>

The linking of assessment categories with concordant management recommendations further enhances sound medical practice. In some settings, a discordant management recommendation may be appropriate, related to unique clinical circumstances. An explanation of the discordant recommendation added to the report can provide nuanced guidance in these situations.

An incomplete (category 0) assessment is given for screening examinations when additional imaging evaluation is recommended before it is appropriate to render a final assessment. It is good practice for a recall (category 0) assessment to include suggestions for the next course of action (e.g., additional evaluation with diagnostic imaging). Category 0 may also be used in the setting of an incomplete diagnostic examination due to the patient leaving before the diagnostic examination is complete.

If the exam is negative or benign, a recommendation can be made to continue or resume screening at the appropriate interval. If a BI-RADS 3 is rendered, the recommended follow-up interval can be specifically outlined. If a suspicious abnormality is identified, the report should indicate that biopsy is recommended. This is an assessment for which the interpreting physician has sufficient concern for malignancy that tissue diagnosis is warranted based on imaging findings. It is good practice to include the recommended method of tissue diagnosis (e.g., stereotactic biopsy, ultrasound-guided biopsy, etc.).</div>

A trace amount of peri-implant fluid or effusion around an implant is normal. More than a trace amount of peri-implant fluid can be due to infection, a benign effusion/seroma, or more rarely breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a non-Hodgkin lymphoma of T-cell origin. The factors that contribute to the development of BIA-ALCL are not fully elucidated but are felt to include chronic inflammation with subsequent malignant transformation of activated T cells. With the increasing use of breast implants, BIA-ALCL has emerged as a rare yet important diagnosis. BIA-ALCL most often presents with a delayed peri-implant effusion on imaging (considered suspicious if > 1 year after placement) but may also present with masses. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of infection or trauma, a delayed (> 1 year after placement) persistent peri-implant effusion should be regarded with suspicion and fine-needle aspiration or biopsy of peri-implant fluid collections and/or masses should be performed to evaluate for BIA-ALCL. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality to further assess and sample suspicious peri-implant fluid detected on MRI.

                <div class="document-content">The only postsurgical sonographic findings that are characteristically benign involve fluid collections, especially postoperative seromas that appear entirely cystic. Seromas may have septations, internal debris or contain both cystic and solid-appearing components, but they should be avascular. Most other postsurgical findings, especially those involving scar tissue, usually display suspicious sonographic findings, such as posterior shadowing, hypoechogenicity, irregular shape, occasionally spiculated margin, and architectural distortion. To avoid unnecessary biopsy, interpretation of breast imaging studies of the treated breast should be made with reference to clinical history of previous surgery, with a skin scar apparent by visual inspection at the location of the sonographic findings often sufficient. If there is uncertainty whether the ultrasound finding correlates with the scar and mammographic finding, a linear scar marker can be placed on the skin at the site of incision with a mammographic view tangential to the scar marker that correlated with US findings. The histopathology of the tumor, margin status at the time of excision, and history of radiation therapy and chemotherapy should also be taken into account when imaging findings are interpreted. Comparison with previous studies is crucial for accuracy in follow-up.

Postsurgical scars commonly evolve over time, usually contracting as they develop marginal indistinctness and spiculation. These interval changes are observed more commonly at mammography but increasingly are observed with screening whole-breast US. The common postsurgical changes of edema and skin thickening, which tend to decrease in extent and severity over time, are depicted equally well with mammography and US, and in this context are considered to be benign. The remaining postsurgical changes that are visible at US are more accurately assessed at mammography.

                <div class="document-content">Elastography has been included in the lexicon because it is available as a feature on many US units, and it is important to define criteria and name descriptors for elasticity assessment. Elasticity is an assessment of the stiffness of a mass and its surrounding breast tissue. In general, malignant masses are expected to be stiffer than benign masses. However, there are many exceptions, with some malignancies being soft (e.g., mucinous carcinoma, DCIS, necrotic cancers) and some benign masses being hard (e.g., scarring, fibrosis, complex fibroadenomas [52]). Therefore, it must be emphasized that the ultrasonic criteria of mass shape, margin, and echogenicity are far more predictive for malignancy than stiffness, and elastography evaluation should not override the more predictive morphologic features of malignancy for patient management. Additionally, this technique is operator dependent, and image quality significantly impacts the accuracy of interpretation [53].

The primary utility of elastography involves improving the ability of ultrasonography to distinguish borderline versus suspicious masses [54, 55]. Specifically, if a mass demonstrates morphologic characteristics consistent with a BI-RADS category 3 assessment (probably benign) but suspicious elastography features, one may consider upgrading the final assessment to BI-RADS category 4A (low suspicion for malignancy). On the other hand, if a mass demonstrates morphologic characteristics consistent with a BI-RADS category 4A assessment (low suspicion for malignancy) but benign elastography features, one may consider downgrading the final assessment to BI-RADS category 3 (probably benign). Elastography's capability to further characterize borderline suspicious findings depends on the subcategorization of BI-RADS category 4 abnormalities into 4A, 4B, and 4C. Currently, elastography should not be applied to the downgrading of BI-RADS category 4B and 4C abnormalities.

Currently, there are two methods of elasticity measurement: strain elastography measures tissue stiffness via lesion compressibility; shear wave elastography measures the propagation speed of shear waves through tissue, as produced by acoustic force [54]. Ultimately, elasticity assessments are categorized as soft, intermediate, or hard. Stiffness assessments are typically displayed on a color scale or grayscale. Importantly, elastography techniques and stiffness scales vary by US vendor and may be configurable by the end user. As elastography techniques continue to evolve, radiologists and US vendors should agree upon a universally standard color scale and/or grayscale to promote consistency.

Quantitative and semi-quantitative measurements have been proposed for shear and strain elastography, respectively [56]. For shear wave elastography, shear wave propagation speed can be assessed in the breast tissue for a quantitative measurement, often reported in kPa or m/s. Since malignant masses are generally stiffer than benign masses, malignancies have higher elasticity measurements. In a large multinational study, the specificity of ultrasound for mass assessment significantly improved using quantitative maximum stiffness cutoff values of 160 kPa or greater for hard, suspicious lesions and 80 kPa or less for soft, probably benign lesions [54]. Stiffness was measured in the mass or the surrounding tissue. However, optimal stiffness cutoff values to distinguish benign and malignant masses have not yet been established and remain under investigation. Moreover, the threshold values cited above are vendor specific. Radiologists may internally monitor outcomes with their specific US units and review the elastography recommendations of their US unit vendors.

During elastography, benign masses often appear smaller on elastography images relative to the corresponding B-mode images, and malignant masses often appear larger on elastography images relative to the corresponding B-mode images. This observation has resulted in three semi-quantitative measures for strain elastography stiffness: elastography-to-B-mode

length (E/B) ratio, 5-point color scale (elasticity score), and strain ratio. For E/B ratio: Length measurement on the elastography image compared to the B-mode image results in the E/B ratio. An E/B ratio of 1 or higher is considered suspicious for malignancy, and an E/B ratio under 1 is more commonly associated with benign findings. With E/B ratio calculations, gray-scale elastography imaging may be more accurate than color elastography [57]. For the 5-point color scale, color elastography images are assessed: 1 = soft throughout, 2 = mixed soft and hard, 3 = hard but smaller on elastography than B-mode, 4 = hard and equal in size on elastography and B-mode, 5 = hard and larger on elastography than B-mode. A 5-point color scale score of 4 or 5 is considered suspicious for malignancy, and a 5-point color scale score of 3 or lower is more commonly associated with benign findings. For the strain ratio: a region of interest measuring the elasticity of normal subcutaneous fat is compared to a region of interest measuring the elasticity of the abnormality. The resultant strain ratio and cutoff values to distinguish malignancy versus benignity are not standardized at this time, and radiologists should review the elastography recommendations of their US unit vendor.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Fat necrosis may be related to surgical or non-surgical breast trauma and has a variety of appearances on mammography and US [65]. In the acute phase, early fat necrosis will present on US as local edema of the breast fat and will transform into a mixed solid and cystic mass, a complicated cyst or an anechoic cyst, often within 2-6 months. After 1-2 years, fat necrosis may evolve to a calcified oil cyst or spiculated mass, both associated with posterior shadowing and the latter more often associated with surgical trauma. Although the US appearance of fat necrosis may be variable and be associated with suspicious findings, correlation with mammography often confirms the benign diagnosis. Oil cysts (whether solitary or multiple, calcified or non-calcified) are characteristically benign on mammography but not necessarily so on US. Hence, when fat necrosis is suspected at US, and when other more suspicious sonographic features are displayed that potentially represent fat necrosis, the next step before rendering a final assessment should be correlation with a concurrent mammography examination that likely will justify a benign (BI-RADS category 2) assessment that cannot be made with US alone.

Because this marker is placed directly on top of or surrounding the skin lesion, both the marker and the skin lesion will be seen in the same location on mammographic images obtained in any projection. This approach enables the interpreting physician to discount the importance of the demarcated mammographic finding, which is definitively confirmed to represent a benign skin lesion.

Similarly, the technologist may use a radiopaque marker to indicate the location of a palpable abnormality in the breast. The technologist should place the marker at the location on the skin that is expected to overlie the palpable lesion when the breast is compressed in a given mammographic projection [56]. Visibility of the marker on the mammogram may serve as an indicator that the palpable lesion has been included in the image field. This approach assists the interpreting physician in correlating the presence or absence of any visible mammographic finding(s) with the palpable lesion.

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">Is it necessary for a breast imaging facility to separate the medical audit into screening and diagnostic components?

FDA regulations [1] do not require auditing at the level of complexity described in parts of this section, including separate auditing of screening and diagnostic examinations. However, periodic auditing is sound medical practice and the best way for a breast imaging practice and individual radiologists to ascertain acceptable clinical performance. The ACR strongly recommends that screening and diagnostic examinations be audited separately because the outcomes of these two types of examinations differ substantially and adjustments in practice patterns, in response to the audit metrics, may significantly impact patient care and outcomes [5, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29–31]. For practices that are unable to segregate examinations by screening versus diagnostic indication, mathematical models have been developed to provide guidance on how to evaluate combined audit data [32].

2. Published benchmarks for PPV<sub>2</sub> and PPV<sub>3</sub> are similar. Which one is the more accurate indicator of interpretive performance?

PPV $_2$  and PPV $_3$  are performance measures that relate primarily to diagnostic mammography examination. PPV $_2$  involves the positive predictive value calculation (percentage of positive examinations that are TP) based on the number of examinations for which tissue diagnosis is *recommended*, whereas PPV $_3$  involves the same calculation based on the number of examinations for which tissue diagnosis is *performed*. Because biopsies performed are more likely to yield a cancer diagnosis than biopsies not performed, one would expect the value of PPV $_3$  to be somewhat higher than that of PPV $_2$ , and this is what is observed in almost all breast imaging audits. PPV $_3$  is the more accurate indicator of cancer status because definitive biopsy results may be obtained in virtually all cases. Furthermore, the data collected for the PPV $_3$  calculation are the same as what is required by the FDA regulations [1]. However, the PPV $_2$  calculation directly reflects the performance of the interpreting radiologist (involving all examinations for which tissue diagnosis is recommended), whereas the interpreting radiologist has no control over the subset of PPV $_2$  cases that undergo biopsy and qualify for the PPV $_3$  calculation. Therefore, although PPV $_3$  is the more accurate indicator of cancer status, PPV $_2$  is the more meaningful indicator of interpretive performance.

3. Why is it important to use more than one or two breast imaging audit metrics when evaluating performance?

A breast imaging audit is clinically relevant to the extent that it provides meaningful indicators of interpretive performance. The more data collected and analyzed, the more comprehensive an understanding one may derive about underlying interpretive performance [43]. Analysis of performance based on a single metric is of little value. For example, what useful information can one deduce from the recall rate alone? One can deduce simply that a given percentage of screened women are recommended for additional imaging evaluation, but nothing about how frequently biopsy is recommended, the likelihood of cancer when biopsy is recommended, the frequency of cancer detection, or whether detected cancers are clinically

occult or early in stage (hence favorable in prognosis). A similar, very limited amount of information may be derived from any other single performance metric or pair of metrics. Instead, the data collected in and derived from the *Basic Clinically Relevant Audit*, as described in Section II (see page 816) should provide sufficient insight into the interpretive performance of a breast imaging practice and its individual radiologists to improve patient care and outcomes. The *More Complete Audit Section III* (see page 833) should provide an even more comprehensive understanding of performance.

4. In my practice, we perform approximately 30,000 screening mammography and approximately 5000 diagnostic mammography examinations per year in a major metropolitan area in the United States. We have state-of-the-art equipment and about half of our radiologists are fellowship trained. However, when we compare our audit outcomes with the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) benchmark outcomes listed in the current version of the BI-RADS Manual, our screening mammography performance for cancer detection rate, positive predictive value 1 (PPV<sub>1</sub>), PPV<sub>2</sub> and PPV<sub>3</sub> is below average; only our recall rate is better than average performance. We had expected to do better. What should we do to improve?

The BCSC data should not be used as benchmarks to compare the performance of a group of radiologists at a mammography facility without linkage to a registry. The BCSC data are linked to tumor registry data, but most mammography facilities in the United States are not. Because of the registry linkage, there is more complete and reliable cancer ascertainment which leads to higher cancer detection rates and PPVs than an average practice in the United States. Except for the recall rate, the benchmarks reported by the BCSC are not likely to be achieved by a mammography facility in the United States [31].

5. I consult regularly with a breast surgeon before we jointly decide whether a biopsy or surveillance is the best management recommendation. The Manual does not seem to address this situation. Should these images be reported as BI-RADS category 3, or category 4, or possibly category 0, in the interim? Category 0 specifies additional imaging, not a surgical consult. Is there a provision for "waiting for consult"?

No, there is no BI-RADS assessment category that includes "waiting for consult." The BI-RADS assessment category should align with the findings on imaging. "Waiting for consult" or "surgical consultation recommended" is not an assessment category; it is a recommendation. If the surgeon and/or the patient chooses a different management not aligned with the assessment category, that information can be mentioned in the impression of the report but is not necessary. Further reading in the sections titled, BI-RADS Assessment Concordant with Management Recommendation and the BI-RADS Assessment Does Not Match Management Recommendation may be helpful.

6. Why is it that recall rate, PPV₁ and PPV₂ can be so different when comparing mammography, US and MRI?

The outcome parameters recall rate and PPV<sub>1</sub> relate only to purely screening examinations. Recall rate is the percentage of all screening examinations that are positive (BI-RADS categories 0, 3, 4, and 5). PPV<sub>1</sub> is the percentage of all positive screening examinations (BI-RADS categories 0, 3, 4, and 5) that result in a tissue diagnosis of cancer within 1 standard interval (1 year in the U.S.). PPV<sub>2</sub> represents the percentage of all diagnostic (or rarely, screening) examinations recommended for tissue diagnosis (BI-RADS categories 4 and 5) that result in a diagnosis of cancer within 1 standard interval (1 year in the U.S.). PPV<sub>1</sub> and PPV<sub>2</sub> can be significantly different for each modality and accepted practice patterns. For example, nearly all positive screening mammography assessments are BI-RADS category 0, among which fewer than half then are assessed as BI-RADS category 4 or 5 at diagnostic imaging. Screening assessments of BI-RADS category 3, 4 or 5 are rare and discouraged for mammography

but are possible. Positive breast MRI screening examinations, however, frequently receive a BI-RADS category 4 or 5 assessment and category 0 and 3 are much less common. For mammography, the difference between PPV $_1$  and PPV $_2$  is large because PPV $_1$  includes many BI-RADS category 0 results and PPV $_2$  includes only BI-RADS category 4 and 5 results. For breast MRI the difference between PPV $_1$  and PPV $_2$  will be small because positive MRI screening examinations frequently receive a BI-RADS category 4 or 5 assessment (include in both PPV $_1$  and PPV $_2$ ) and category 0 and 3 (included only in PPV $_1$ ) are much less common.</div>

                <div class="document-content">The amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT) is the relative volume of the breast comprised of the fibroglandular structures. On breast MRI the amount or volume of fibroglandular tissue is visible in 3 dimensions. Unlike mammography for which the breast density due to the amount of FGT impacts accuracy, on MRI larger amounts of FGT do not impact diagnostic performance.

The amount FGT should be subjectively assessed and assigned based on the relative volume of the breast comprised of fibroglandular tissue on T1-weighted imaging with or without fat removal. Similar to mammographic breast density assessment, the amount of fibroglandular tissue is not reported using percentages. The term density should not be used to describe MRI FGT as density is an x-ray imaging not MRI property.

The amount of FGT should be reported in one of four categories:

- (A) Almost entirely fatty
- (B) Scattered fibroglandular tissue
- (C) Heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue
- (D) Extreme fibroglandular tissue

Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) is benign, physiologic enhancement of the fibroglandular tissue. BPE is common, particularly in premenopausal patients. Typical BPE patterns include a peripheral "picture-frame" or "cortical" appearance, and a pattern of scattered dots of enhancement throughout the breast. BPE can also appear as more complex patterns including somewhat mass-like and non-mass-like areas of enhancement.

The level of BPE should be subjectively assessed using the early post-contrast images (60–120 seconds after contrast). The BPE level is based on the qualitative proportion or amount of fibroglandular tissue demonstrating benign-appearing enhancement. If subtracted series are used to assess BPE it is important to check for motion between the pre- and post-contrast series for appropriate categorization of BPE, since motion misregistration may create "pseudoenhancement" on the subtracted images.

The BPE level should be reported in one of four categories:

- a) Minimal (includes no enhancement)
- b) Mild
- c) Moderate
- d) Marked

BPE may be symmetric or asymmetric. It is optional to report the symmetry/asymmetry of BPE. If asymmetric, BPE may be assigned individually for each breast, or alternatively overall across both breasts using the higher BPE level. Common causes for asymmetric BPE include prior breast cancer treated with partial mastectomy and radiation therapy which results in lower level of ipsilateral BPE, and asymmetric amounts of fibroglandular tissue.</div>

At minimum, a single BI-RADS assessment category should be given for each breast MRI examination according to the highest order actionable assessment category, using the hierarchy of assessments 5 > 4 > 0 > 6 > 3 > 2/1. For example, an examination with a right breast biopsyproven malignancy BI-RADS category 6 finding and also a left breast BI-RADS category 4 suspicious finding should be assigned an examination-level BI-RADS assessment category 4, since the suspicious category 4 finding is an immediately actionable item which supersedes the action for the biopsy-proven malignancy.

It is not required but can be very helpful to assign a separate BI-RADS assessment category for each breast, to more clearly distinguish between multiple findings and their assessments and management recommendations. When breast-level assessment categories are assigned, the same highest order actionable assessment category hierarchy of 5 > 4 > 0 > 6 > 3 > 2/1 should be used for each breast. For example, for an examination with a right breast biopsy-proven malignancy BI-RADS category 6 finding and also a right breast BI-RADS category 4 suspicious finding, and no left breast findings, the breast-level assessments are right breast assessment category 4 and left breast assessment category 1.

Further, it is not required but can be helpful to assign a separate BI-RADS assessment for each finding that is BI-RADS category 3 or higher, to even more clearly distinguish between multiple findings and their assessments and management recommendations.

Overall, including for auditing at the examination level, the breast MRI examination is coded according to the highest order BI-RADS assessment category across both breasts.</div>

                <div class="document-content">New to this version of the ACR BI-RADS Manual is complete outcomes monitoring of examinations with initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments. The purpose of monitoring BI-RADS category 3 outcomes is to encourage appropriate use. The literature has confirmed that BI-RADS category 3

is occasionally being used incorrectly for findings that should be assessed as category 2 or 4 resulting in unnecessary follow-up examinations or delays in appropriate tissue sampling [2–4]. Adherence to strict criteria for appropriate BI-RADS category 3 assessments is critical for patient safety. For example, data from the National Mammography Database (NMD) from 2009–2018 indicate that the majority of BI-RADS category 3 findings following screening mammography recall were downgraded to BI-RADS categories 1 or 2 before 24 months of total imaging surveillance, indirectly implying some inappropriate overuse of BI-RADS category 3 assessments for benign findings [5]. More appropriate BI-RADS category 3 use is desired. Note that monitoring only the frequency of BI-RADS category 3 assessments and the percentage of initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments that result in a breast cancer diagnosis will not determine the extent to which benign and suspicious findings are being assessed as BI-RADS category 3; this is facilitated only by the additional auditing detailed in the More Complete Audit (section III. B. Derived Data to be Calculated #10).

Only the initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments, first assigned either at screening (which is discouraged) or at initial diagnostic imaging (See above "Data to be collected" #5 and "Derived data to be calculated" #9), are included in the total denominator. Table 1 should be used to correctly designate examinations as either screening or diagnostic based on indication. The reason for including only initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments, rather than all BI-RADS category 3 assessments, is that the established likelihood of malignancy for BI-RADS category 3 mammogram findings of 2% or less was calculated by dividing the number of malignant BI-RADS category 3 examinations by the total number of initial BI-RADS category 3 examinations. Including all, rather than initial, BI-RADS category 3 assessments would count each finding more than once within this calculation, falsely increase the denominator, and yield an inaccurately low percentage of BI-RADS category 3 assessments that result in a breast cancer diagnosis. Therefore, follow-up BI-RADS category 3 assessments repeated at diagnostic imaging after an initial BI-RADS category 3 assessment are tracked but not counted towards the denominator for the audit. Stated simply, including only initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments allows for accurate correlation with the already established likelihood of malignancy for BI-RADS category 3 mammogram findings of 2% or less.

BI-RADS category 3 auditing should be performed separately for screening and diagnostic imaging. Moreover, <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments at diagnostic imaging prompted by a BI-RADS category 0 screening examination should be monitored apart from <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments at diagnostic imaging not prompted by a BI-RADS category 0 screening examination. This is similar to the separate auditing of diagnostic mammography examinations performed for work-up of abnormal screening mammograms and palpable findings.

BI-RADS category 3 is not an indeterminate category for a radiologist to invoke when undecided between BI-RADS assessment categories 2 (benign) and 4 (suspicious). Moreover, category 3 assessments are <u>not</u> appropriate for screening mammography and should be assigned only after appropriate diagnostic imaging. This allows for prompt verification of characteristically benign findings and timely diagnosis of some rapidly growing breast cancers [4]. Certain details and definitions must be understood for successful outcome monitoring of initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments:

- In the U.S. the most common surveillance interval for a BI-RADS 3 finding is 2 years, therefore, a positive outcome is a breast cancer diagnosis within 2 years of the <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessment. Thus, positive "truth" for <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments is defined as a breast cancer diagnosis occurring during the cancer ascertainment period of 2 years.
- 2. The audit of <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments should be performed no sooner than one year after completion of the cancer ascertainment period of 2 years.

- Auditing <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments from diagnostic imaging in symptomatic
  patients is expected to reveal a higher likelihood of malignancy than auditing <u>initial</u> BI-RADS
  category 3 assessments prompted by screening in asymptomatic patients given the inherently
  higher pre-test probability of malignancy.
- 4. Robust literature delineating findings with a likelihood of malignancy of 2% or less supports BI-RADS category 3 assessment and periodic surveillance for specific mammographic and sonographic findings (see Mammography and Ultrasound sections). The scientific evidence for surveillance of specific MRI findings has not reached consensus and the use of BI-RADS category 3 for MRI is often based on radiologist experience. Thus, the BI-RADS category 3 audit for MRI for one facility may not be relevant for other facilities. Radiologists are encouraged to use BI-RADS descriptors appropriately and consistently to facilitate future investigation of imaging findings with a likelihood of malignancy of 2% or less.

Outcomes for initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments: Explained in detail within Figure 4 below.

# BASIC CLINICALLY RELEVANT AUDIT CALCULATIONS FOR BI-RADS CATEGORY 3 AUDITING

It is also important to remember that the cancer ascertainment period for <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments is defined as the recommended total imaging surveillance of two years for BI-RADS category 3 findings.

- Outcomes for <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments made at screening: The flowchart includes no <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments made at screening (strongly discouraged with screening mammography). Thus, two of three metrics below equal zero for this example.
  - a) Frequency of initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments at screening:

$$= \frac{Initial\ category\ 3\ assessments}{Total\ screening\ examinations} \times 100 = \frac{0}{200,000} \times 100 = 0\%$$

b) Percentage of screening examinations that result in an initial BI-RADS category 3 assessment at diagnostic imaging:

$$=\frac{2,000}{200.000}=1\%$$

c) Percentage of <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments at screening that result in a breast cancer diagnosis:

$$= \frac{Malignant\ initial\ category\ 3\ assessments}{Total\ initial\ category\ 3\ assessments} \times 100 = 0 \times 100 = 0\%$$

                <div class="document-content">There is no single protocol for performing high quality contrast-enhanced breast MRI. However, several basic principles should be followed. Breast MRI sequences should balance spatial resolution, temporal resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and field-of-view.

Detailed standards for protocols can be found in the ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Breast [1] and the ACR Breast MRI Accreditation Program [2].

An MR scanner with sufficient field strength to achieve high spatial resolution should be used. Typically, 1.5T or a higher field strength is required to achieve sufficient quality. A dedicated bilateral breast coil should be used, and simultaneous bilateral acquisition should be performed. Bilateral imaging allows evaluation of the bilateral breasts and regional lymph nodes, and in the setting of mastectomy allows assessment of the mastectomy site with or without reconstruction. Bilateral imaging also improves interpretation, as having the contralateral breast is helpful to compare the level and pattern of background parenchymal enhancement between breasts and for the detection of subtle unique abnormalities.

Gadolinium contrast is currently required for breast cancer detection and assessment, and contrast should be administered using a weight-based dose. Non-contrast breast MRI methods for cancer detection are investigational at this time. Breast MRI that is performed only to assess implant integrity does not require contrast.

Protocols should be standardized as much as possible across different magnets within a practice, particularly for the timing of the early (previously "initial") post-contrast sequence, defined as the series obtained at approximately 60–120 seconds after administration of contrast, the usual standard clinical sequence timepoint when the majority of breast cancers are most evident. Standardization provides consistency for technologists and radiologists and allows better comparison of examinations over time for an individual patient.

Breast MRI reports should describe the key acquisition techniques, including the field strength and pulse sequences utilized. Contrast enhanced exams should include the dose and type of gadolinium contrast agent and the details of contrast injection. Temporal resolution (including any delay after contrast administration, number and length of post-contrast sequences) should be reported for dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) series. When utilized, computer aided evaluation of kinetics or other post-processing techniques should also be described. Since most parameters will remain constant, standardized language for MRI techniques can be used in the reports. Finally, significant imaging artifacts such as from patient motion, susceptibility artifacts, fat suppression failure/inhomogeneity, and suboptimal contrast injection should be described.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Since the implementation of federally mandated mammographic breast density reporting legislation in the United States on September 10, 2024, the performance of breast ultrasound as an adjunctive screening modality to mammography in women with dense breasts will undoubtedly increase. At the same time, we are increasingly accruing knowledge regarding the clinical significance of overall breast density as well as its subcomponents.

Breast density at mammography is associated with a decrease in mammographic sensitivity ("masking effect") and an increase in risk of breast cancer. While research and data are not as extensive in these areas for ultrasound, we do know that tissue composition affects the detection of lesions with ultrasound, and recent research is showing that ultrasound may also serve to assess risk. In Tissue Composition, we have continued the description of the three tissue patterns of background echotexture used in the prior edition (homogeneous, heterogeneous – fat, heterogeneous — fibroglandular), but we are additionally introducing a new element termed glandular tissue component (GTC). This new element of GTC is predicated on the principle that ultrasound can be used to distinguish between glandular tissue (which appears hypoechoic) and fibrous stroma (which appears relatively echogenic). We propose a classification schema to semiquantify the amount of glandular tissue compared to stromal tissue using the terms minimal (< 25% of hypoechoic glandular tissue within the echogenic fibrous stroma), mild (25% – 49%), moderate (50% - 74%), and marked (> 75%), similar to that of background parenchymal enhancement at MRI. High GTC has been found to be associated with no or only mild lobular involution, and it is perhaps this relationship that accounts for the observed association between GTC and breast cancer risk [19, 20, 22, 82]. As with any new concept, especially in ultrasound which is highly operator dependent, assessing GTC properly will require learning and experience. Nevertheless, we believe that it is appropriate to introduce this new element so that awareness can be raised and knowledge can be gained regarding the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology underlying breast cancer.

# GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

# A. BREAST ANATOMY

The breast is located on the chest wall between the second and sixth ribs within layers of the superficial pectoral fascia. The fat and fibroglandular tissues of the breast lie between the superficial layer of this fascia just beneath the skin and the deep layer of the fascia just anterior to the pectoral major muscle (Figure 1).

![](images/_page_3_Figure_4.jpeg)

Figure 1 – NORMAL BREAST ANATOMY. Diagram of breast anatomy in coronal plane (A) and axial plane (B).

The breast is comprised of approximately 12 to 20 sections or lobes. Each lobe consists of multiple smaller lobules (i.e., the fibroglandular tissue that if properly stimulated by hormones produces milk). The lobules start with small peripheral branches and end in a large collecting duct, its punctum visible on the nipple (Figure 2). The most peripheral ducts, the intra-lobular terminal ducts, end in terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) that give rise to common malignant and benign pathologies.

**Figure 2** – NORMAL BREAST ANATOMY. Radial view shows the normal anatomy of a lactiferous duct from its lobules at the periphery, arching anteriorly (arrowhead) towards the nipple. The duct is within the fibroglandular zone of tissue beneath a layer of fat.

Breast development (thelarche) often marks the beginning of female puberty (Figure 3). The female breast at puberty resembles gynecomastia in a male with hypoechoic tissue immediately posterior to the nipple. Because these young patients ordinarily do not undergo mammography, it is important not to misinterpret the hypoechoic retroareolar breast bud as an abnormality requiring biopsy. This area should be recognized as normal for this age group; if it is removed surgically, the breast will not develop.

Figure 3 - NORMAL BREAST ANATOMY - PUBERTAL. Expected hypoechoic tissue immediately posterior to the nipple (arrow).

The arterial supply to the breast is provided by the subclavian and axillary arteries and their lateral thoracic, thoracoacromial, superior thoracic, and internal mammary branches. The venous vasculature lies predominantly just deep to the skin. Over 90% of the lymphatics of the breast drain into the ipsilateral axilla, with a small percentage draining into the internal mammary chain. In patients who have had axillary dissections or mastectomies extending into the axilla, lymphatic drainage may cross to the contralateral axilla.

The axilla contains lymph nodes, the brachial plexus, and the axillary artery and vein. The number and size of normal axillary lymph nodes vary widely from individual to individual. There is no upper limit of size for a normal axillary lymph node if the cortex remains appropriately thin. Cortical thickness is an imperfect measure of lymph node benignity, but most normal nodes have a cortex no thicker than 3 mm [1]. Side-to-side symmetry of size, shape, and number of nodes may help distinguish normal from abnormal. Nodes may be depicted in the axillae on mammograms; commonly two, three, or more can be identified as circumscribed oval, often reniform, masses with hilar fat and cortices of soft tissue density. With US, normal axillary or intramammary lymph nodes have echogenic fatty hila and cortices that are typically hypoechoic (Figure 4).

Although preliminary results for CEM and MRI suggest it may be possible to differentiate benign from malignant distortion based on enhancement [11], there is insufficient published data to confidently make this distinction. As a result, the LE assessment becomes crucial for interpretation. Should unexplained distortion persist on LE and conventional mammographic and tomosynthesis images, it should be pursued with percutaneous biopsy regardless of its enhancement pattern.</div>

Recent amendments to MQSA regulations, which took effect on Sept. 10, 2024, resulted in the creation of two new assessment categories for mammography under category 0 (replacing the previous combined descriptive verbiage of "Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation and/or Prior for comparison"). The two new MQSA-required categories are: Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation, used to indicate that the examination is incompletely evaluated, and the recommendation is for additional imaging evaluation (e.g., supplementary mammographic views and/or US); and Category 0: Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison, to be used if retrieval of previous examinations for comparison is indicated before a final assessment can be rendered. For consistency, this updated verbiage has been generalized across the Manual for the other modalities. However, since prior studies desired for comparison may not be limited to mammograms, the terminology in the sections other than the Mammography chapter has been modified to say Category 0: Incomplete: Need prior imaging for comparison.

Category 0 is used to indicate that the breast is incompletely evaluated. The use of category 0 should be rare for breast MRI, because there is typically enough information from the MRI examination alone for appropriate interpretation including characterization and assessment of findings.

The infrequent use of category 0 should be limited to the following three scenarios:

 Additional imaging is needed for further <u>characterization</u> of breast MRI findings, typically with mammography and/or ultrasound.

This application should be reserved for particular MRI findings which appear highly likely but not definitively specific benign entities, for which further imaging is needed for <u>characterization</u> to confirm suspected benign etiology. One example is an MRI mass that appears likely but not definitively a lymph node for which ultrasound is needed for complete characterization

(although most lymph nodes will be fully characterized by the MRI alone and not warrant additional imaging). Another example is an area of MRI enhancement which appears likely but not definitively fat necrosis for which mammography is needed for complete characterization (although most fat necrosis will be fully characterized by the MRI alone and not warrant additional imaging).

When category 0 is used for this scenario, the recommendation should be **Need additional imaging evaluation**. The report should also include the type of recommended imaging, and contingency assessment and management recommendations for if the MRI findings cannot be found or better characterized by additional imaging. For example, a report describing an MRI mass that is likely but not definitively a lymph node with assessment category 0 and recommendation for ultrasound should include a contingency assessment and recommendation based on the MRI appearance and level of suspicion for if the finding cannot be found or better characterized with ultrasound.

Category 0 should not be used when findings are sufficiently characterized by MRI and additional imaging is being recommended for <u>detection</u> to guide follow-up or biopsy. For example, a finding that has probably benign MRI features should be assessed as category 3, even if additional imaging with ultrasound is recommended to <u>detect</u> the findings to facilitate ultrasound rather than MRI follow-up. A finding that has suspicious or highly suggestive MRI features should be assessed as category 4 or 5, even if additional imaging with ultrasound is recommended to detect the findings to facilitate ultrasound biopsy.

2) Comparison with prior imaging studies is needed to interpret the breast MRI examination.

Correlation with prior breast imaging studies can be important for interpretation. However, comparison to prior breast imaging studies is not required for all breast MRI examinations, since the MRI examinations alone are most often sufficient for interpretation including characterization and assessment of findings. Comparison to priors is warranted when the radiologist believes that evaluating features or stability on prior studies is necessary to fully characterize MRI findings. Importantly, for the clinical indication of current breast cancer, the MRI should be interpreted with direct correlation to the prior imaging related to the cancer diagnosis whenever possible, and the MRI report should specifically include the location and size of the current cancer on prior imaging. When category 0 is used for this scenario, the recommendation should be **Need prior imaging for comparison.** 

3) Additional imaging is needed due to a technically inadequate breast MRI.

For example, an intended contrast-enhanced MRI for contrast was not successfully administered should be designated category 0, and the recommendation should be for repeat breast MRI for technical reasons.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Assessment-management concordance is a hallmark of appropriate interpretation. Concordance ensures that referring clinicians and/or patients understand the report recommendations, which helps to reduce confusion and incorrect treatment. Appropriate management recommendations for BI-RADS assessment categories are outlined in Table 4.

In earlier editions of the BI-RADS Manual, management recommendations were linked to assessment categories. Starting with the 5th Edition, management recommendations were unlinked from assessment categories to provide more flexibility when describing special case scenarios or when clinical factors necessitate alternative management recommendations. Discordant management recommendations should be used only in appropriate clinical scenarios and should be clearly documented in the report to inform the referring provider and the patient.

A common clinical scenario in which the appropriate management recommendation may appear to be discordant with the proper BI-RADS assessment category occurs when there are no imaging findings in a patient who has a palpable breast abnormality. Typically, the breast imaging report should indicate a negative (BI-RADS category 1) assessment, because there are no imaging findings to describe. However, if there is sufficient concern that a palpable cancer is not visible at breast imaging, the interpreting physician may suggest surgical consultation or tissue diagnosis. These management recommendations would be discordant with a negative assessment. The correct approach to reporting in this scenario is to provide a negative (BI-RADS category 1) assessment with a concordant management recommendation for routine mammography screening. This should be followed with a sentence recommending clinical management to include surgical consultation or tissue diagnosis if clinically indicated.

Another discordant clinical scenario involves a patient with a painful simple (characteristically benign) cyst for which therapeutic aspiration is offered for symptomatic relief. The correct reporting approach is to provide a benign (BI-RADS category 2) assessment with a concordant management recommendation for routine mammography screening, but to follow this with a sentence recommending aspiration to relieve the discomfort produced by the cyst.

One more example of a discordant clinical scenario occurs in a patient who has a ruptured implant but no imaging findings suggestive of malignancy. The correct approach to reporting in this scenario is to provide a benign (BI-RADS category 2) assessment with a concordant management recommendation for routine mammography screening, but to follow this with a sentence recommending surgical consultation to address proper management of the ruptured implant.

The correct approach to reporting discordant interpretive scenarios is that a) the assessment category should reflect the imaging findings of the case, b) a concordant management recommendation should be provided for this assessment, but c) an additional sentence should recommend the additional (apparently discordant) management appropriate for the

scenario. This approach provides flexibility in reporting to allow for both concordant and discordant components of management to be associated with the imaging-appropriate assessment. The one exception to this rule is non-visualization of a biopsy-proven cancer in the setting of preoperative systemic therapy, which should be assessed as BI-RADS category 6 despite the lack of a residual imaging abnormality.

# 2. ASSESSMENT WHEN MORE THAN ONE BREAST IMAGING EXAMINATION IS REPORTED TOGETHER

The terms used for assessment categories and management recommendations are the same for all imaging modalities. When more than one type of diagnostic examination is performed on the same day, it is preferable that the examinations be reported together. The findings for each examination are described in separate paragraphs, with an overall assessment and management recommendations for the combined examinations. In general, when the assessments for two examinations differ, the overall assessment and management recommendations should be the final assessment in highest order actionable. The following hierarchy of decreasing abnormality is used: categories 5, 4, 0, 6, 3, 2, 1 (Table 5). For example, a diagnostic mammogram is performed to evaluate a palpable concern which is interpreted as normal with a BI-RADS category 1 assessment, but subsequent same-day ultrasound reveals a suspicious mass. The final report, which includes both modalities, should provide an overall assessment of BI-RADS category 4 with a management recommendation for tissue diagnosis. If a BI-RADS category 0 assessment is resolved by subsequent same-day imaging, it would not be considered the highest actionable assessment. For example, if a mammographic mass requires ultrasound evaluation and is shown to be a simple cyst, the overall assessment would be a BI-RADS category 2, not a BI-RADS category 0, even though the category 0 assigned to the mammogram finding is higher in the assessment hierarchy.

                <div class="document-content">Abstractors employed by state, local and hospital registries currently gather information related to a new cancer diagnosis from clinical reports. Most of the information regarding cancer type, size, grade, and receptor status is quickly abstracted from succinct and standardized pathology reports. However, abstractors may resort to the tedious and time-consuming strategy of sifting through other clinical notes. We cannot expect abstractors to retrospectively read multiple radiology and pathology reports to recreate the clinical history to determine the MOD. In addition, if abstractors, or radiologists, already know the patient has breast cancer, will they be able to avoid unconscious bias when assigning MOD? It is imperative that the assignment of initial MOD be accurate, unbiased, easily discoverable by abstractors, and correctly transferred to registries for future scientific investigation.

With inclusion in the BI-RADS Manual, radiologists are strongly encouraged to *prospectively* add a single MOD to the diagnostic imaging report when rendering an assessment of BI-RADS 4 or 5 for each patient who does not already have a current, biopsy-proven diagnosis of breast cancer. The radiologist creating the diagnostic imaging report will need to review recent prior imaging, which is

part of the standard clinical process during the work-up, to determine the MOD. This diagnostic radiologist will have the expertise to understand the subtle nuances of the complete imaging, history and clinical information and be uniquely suited to accurately assign the initial MOD and avoid bias at the time of patient evaluation and report creation prospectively before the tissue diagnosis. The diagnostic radiologist will add a line at the end of the radiology report that reads:

The MOD is Sma/Sdbt/Sus/Smri/Scem/Snuc/So/Pat/Pro/Ppp/N.

The radiologist signs the report as usual, and patient care follows standard protocols. Placing a single initial MOD at the bottom of a positive (BI-RADS 4 or 5) diagnostic report is designed to facilitate discovery of the MOD by the abstractor. Rather than ask the abstractor to retrospectively sift through multiple radiology reports and recreate the sequence of events with clinical history to determine the MOD, we prospectively provide it in a single consistent location: after the impression of the diagnostic breast imaging report. This approach maximizes accuracy and minimizes the added burden on the abstractor.</div>

                <div class="document-content">An asymmetry is tissue unmatched in the other breast that is visible on only one mammographic projection. If a radiologist, especially using information from DBT, can reliably and confidently recognize that a questioned asymmetry is due to normal but superimposed breast structures, no further imaging evaluation will be needed. If, on the other hand, a true lesion cannot be excluded with confidence, especially if the finding is seen on multiple consecutive DBT slices (implying that it has intrinsic volume and actually represents a focal asymmetry simply not visible on the orthogonal view) the patient should be recalled for diagnostic imaging evaluation. Most asymmetries represent the superimposition of normal breast structures. However, on subsequent diagnostic views, an asymmetry confirmed to be a real finding may be determined to represent a mass or focal asymmetry.

Figure 3 – ASYMMETRY (SM). This triangular area of tissue (arrow), although conspicuous, does not meet the criteria for a mass (it was seen only on one view, has a concave contour and interspersed fat). There was no matching finding the contralateral breast. It therefore is characterized as an asymmetry. Diagnostic work-up confirmed that it represented superimposed tissue.

Calcifications can be recognized as echogenic foci, particularly when in a hypoechoic mass or distended lactiferous duct. High-frequency, high-resolution transducers can depict both micro and macrocalcifications, but morphology will not be as readily discernible as at mammography, and correlation with mammography is required for precise analysis. Not all echogenic foci detected on US are related to calcifications, and correlation with mammography (as indicated) can prevent misinterpretation.

Visualization of suspicious calcifications depends on size and depth, as well as the echo pattern of the surrounding tissue. Identification of calcifications also depends on technical parameters such as US equipment, transducer frequency, and operator image settings. Larger extent of calcifications, larger number of calcifications, segmental distribution, malignant etiology, and calcifications surrounded by hypoechoic tissue are more likely to be identified on sonography [37, 38]. Likewise, the calcifications of high grade, comedo-type DCIS are more often seen on US than the calcifications of low grade DCIS [39]. US evaluation of malignant calcifications detected on mammography may also identify a mass or non-mass lesion representing a mammographically occult invasive component. Overall, microcalcifications identified on sonography may have a higher positive predictive value for malignancy compared to microcalcifications seen only on mammography [40].

Calcifications may be described by morphology (macro vs. micro), location within or outside a mass or non-mass lesion, or within a duct. When suspicious calcifications are identified on US, US may be used to provide imaging guidance for percutaneous biopsy [41]. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is particularly useful if stereotactic biopsy is not available or difficult to perform [38]. Of note, specimen radiography is indicated when biopsy is performed for calcifications [27].</div>

                <div class="document-content">Auditing data are more clinically useful if the outcomes observed for a given breast imaging facility or for an individual interpreting physician are compared with standard performance parameters that have been designated as acceptable. To this end, for mammography the numbers obtained for each of the data elements to be calculated in (see Section II Derived data to be calculated, page 817) may be compared to:

- Benchmarks reported by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) and NMD (https:// nrdr.acr.org/Portal/NMD), both of which include data from large numbers of screening and diagnostic mammography examinations that are likely to be representative of practice in the United States (Tables 4 and 7).
- Recommendations derived by a panel of expert breast imaging interpreting physicians, based on critical analysis of scientific data published in the peer-reviewed literature (including BCSC data), as well as extensive personal experience.

Screening US benchmarks (Table 5) have been limited to multi-institutional trials representing practice in the United States and specifically conducted to prospectively establish the performance of US independent from mammography. Trials designed to establish the incremental benefit of screening US in addition to mammography have been excluded to remain consistent with the screening benchmarks for mammography and MRI. There are no published, peer-reviewed data to establish rigorous benchmarks for pure diagnostic ultrasound performed without diagnostic mammography.

Selected MRI benchmarks have been reported for screening breast MRI from clinical trials, from/ across multiple-sites in the BCSC, and from single-site practice audits to be representative of practice in the United States. These include outcomes for different types of MRI (full-protocol, abbreviated) and for different patient populations (e.g., "high risk", dense breasts). Practices should compare their performance to the appropriate benchmarks most relevant to their program (Table 6). New data provide initial audit metrics and benchmarks for breast MRI performed with the specific indication to evaluate the extent of disease (EOD) following a new diagnosis of cancer (Table 8). Note this does not include breast MRI examinations performed to evaluate response to neoadjuvant treatment, short-interval follow-up or problem-solving indications. See MRI chapter for standard examination indications.

                <div class="document-content">All the previous clinical scenarios assume that the BI-RADS assessment category is concordant with the accompanying management recommendation in the breast imaging report. That is, category 1 and 2 assessments accompany recommendations for standard interval screening, category 3 assessments accompany recommendations for imaging surveillance, category 0 assessments accompany recommendations for additional imaging, and category 4 and 5 assessments accompany recommendations for tissue diagnosis. However, just as radiologists occasionally do not follow BI-RADS guidance (by making category 3 assessments at mammography screening, for example) so do they occasionally render breast imaging reports in which the BI-RADS assessment category is discordant with the accompanying management recommendation. There are numerous discordant combinations of assessment category and management recommendation. Two of these are described below to illustrate how to make proper assessments to avoid such discordances.

 A patient has a screening examination assessed as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) with a management recommendation of no action until the next screening examination. (This discordant approach is strongly discouraged and has no scientific support for mammography.)

![](images/_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)

Note: Gray-filled boxes indicate data included in the calculations for BI-RADS category 3 auditing. Blue-filled boxes indicate BI-RADS category 3 assessments that do not meet the definition of an <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessment and are thus excluded from BI-RADS category 3 audit calculations.

**Figure 5** – Flowchart Example to Illustrate Correct and Incorrect Audit Calculations for <u>Initial</u> BI-RADS® Category 3 Assessments.

The discordant assessment and recommendation are troublesome for the audit. The screening examination assessment is classified as a positive (BI-RADS category 3), but the discordant recommendation is classified as negative because no additional imaging or action is recommended until completion of the next standard screening interval. In this discordant scenario, the correct assessment, for the purposes of the audit, is negative which aligns with the recommendation for no action until the next screening. Remember that if the interpreting radiologist had assessed the screening examination as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) with a suggested management of short-interval follow-up (which is not a recommended practice without first performing a diagnostic examination), for auditing purposes, this would be classified as a positive screening examination and included in the calculation of recall rate because additional imaging was recommended before next interval screening.

2. A patient has a baseline mammography screening examination assessed as benign (BI-RADS category 2) with a management recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging in 6 months because of the interpretive uncertainty produced by the availability of only the two standard-projection mammographic views for a finding judged to be very likely benign. For auditing purposes, this incorrectly assessed examination is classified as a positive screening examination because additional imaging is recommended before the next screening. In this scenario, the proper and concordant assessment is incomplete (BI-RADS category 0), recommend additional imaging evaluation, which likely permits a more confident and rapid (diagnostic) category 2 assessment and management recommendation of standard interval screening. Note that at screening, recall for additional imaging is recommended to complete a full diagnostic imaging work-up before confirming a BI-RADS category 3 assessment and recommending short-interval follow-up imaging.</div>

For the facility-wide audit, the most practical approach is the simplest: count each examination once, based on the final assessment after double reading is completed. However, in attributing assessments to the individual radiologists who participate in double reading, the method of assigning responsibility should depend on the type of double reading used.

- 1. If the first radiologist performs thorough interpretations and the second radiologist performs "quick reads" with knowledge of the interpretations made by the first radiologist, looking only to change negative assessments to positive (or alternatively, to change positive assessments to negative), the first radiologist will assume responsibility for all examinations based on their individual assessments, but the second radiologist will assume separate responsibility only for those examinations for which they changed the final assessment.
- 2. If two radiologists interpret examinations independently and consensus is determined by predefined rules (for example, an examination is given a positive final assessment if either radiologist makes a positive individual assessment, or, alternatively, an examination is given a positive final assessment only if both radiologists make positive individual assessments), then each radiologist will assume separate responsibility for examinations based on their individual assessments.

- If two radiologists interpret examinations independently but then arrive at consensus by reviewing examinations and coming to a joint decision, then each radiologist will assume separate responsibility for examinations based on the final assessment after double reading is completed.
- If two radiologists interpret examinations together (simultaneously), then each radiologist
  will assume separate responsibility for examinations based on the joint assessment that
  they make.
- If two radiologists interpret examinations independently but consensus is made by a third
  radiologist, then all three radiologists will assume separate responsibility for examinations,
  the first two readers based on their individual assessments and the consensus reader based
  on the final assessment that he or she makes.

Note that for all previous examples, the assignment of responsibility relates only to the performance of individual radiologists at audit (for quality assurance purposes), not in the clinical-care context that may have medicolegal consequences. The mammography facility that utilizes double reading may choose to adopt different approaches in deciding which radiologist(s) to name on double-read mammography reports.</div>

If necessary, the volume of a mass can be computed and reported by using a 3D transducer (for 2D US, two perpendicular images will allow three measurements to be made). If posterior shadowing is intense, the posterior margin of the mass may be obscured, and the anterior-posterior dimension may not be measurable.

**Figure 1** – LABELING AND MEASUREMENT. When opting to provide multi-dimensional measurements of a cyst rather than the largest diameter, this simple cyst and other obliquely situated masses should be measured as in (A), first finding the longest axis of the mass and then a measurement perpendicular to it. The measurements shown in (B) are incorrect; the rectangular image frame should not be the reference for measuring.

![](images/_page_34_Picture_3.jpeg)

Figure 2 – LABELING AND MEASUREMENT. Pseudocapsule versus echogenic rind. Measurement of a circumscribed mass with abrupt transition such as the fibroadenoma in left image should include the hypoechoic portion and not the surrounding thin hyperechoic rim/pseudocapsule (arrow) that represents normal adjacent compressed tissue. In the right images, the irregular hypoechoic mass with blurry transition from the adjacent tissue is associated with an echogenic rind containing spicules radiating from the mass. Measuring the mass on the right should include the hypoechoic portion and echogenic rind to be more predictive of the size at pathologic evaluation.

When measuring a mass with an indistinct margin and disruption of the surrounding breast architecture and an associated echogenic rind, measurements of the hypoechoic portion should be obtained in three dimensions as described above with inclusion of the central mass and the echogenic rind. Studies have suggested that inclusion of the echogenic rind is more predictive of the actual size at pathologic evaluation [9, 10].

(B) demonstrates the difference between the recordings of the hypoechoic portion only vs the mass inclusive of the hyperechoic rim. If measuring only the hypoechoic portion of this mass, the measurement is foreshortened by approximately 2 mm.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is the foundation of clinical breast MRI, and contrast is currently required for breast cancer detection. During DCE MRI, the uptake and washout of a gadolinium contrast agent in breast tissue is observed over time using pre- and post-contrast imaging series. Breast cancers are characterized by abnormal highly permeable neovascularity and typically enhance quickly with early enhancement in the 60–120 seconds after contrast administration. Therefore, it is important to acquire an early post-contrast sequence in this time frame, because this is when most cancers will be avidly enhancing but background

parenchymal enhancement (BPE) is less likely to have increased to maximum. The early post-contrast sequence at 60–120 seconds is the first post-contrast series in many protocols, but in some techniques may be preceded by other post-contrast images, such as in "faster" protocols with very high temporal resolution initial images that are possible with newer techniques.

Morphologic features, such as for a mass the shape and margin, remain the most important MRI characteristics in predicting malignancy, and routine clinical protocols should prioritize achieving high spatial resolution imaging to best depict morphology. Assessment of the contrast enhancement over time using signal time intensity curves for kinetics may also help characterize MRI findings for which the morphology is not definitively benign or suspicious.

Early phase (previously called initial phase) contrast enhancement describes the enhancement-related signal intensity that occurs in the first 60–120 seconds after contrast injection, and in particular the change in intensity comparing the early time point to the pre-contrast time point. The name for this timepoint has been changed to early compared to the prior BI-RADS Edition because there may be other initial timepoints acquired using faster techniques, see discussion below. Delayed phase contrast enhancement describes the enhancement-related signal intensity that occurs after the first 60–120 seconds after contrast injection or when the curve begins to change, and in particular the change in intensity comparing the delayed time point to the early post-contrast time point. These signal intensity changes over time on the post-contrast series create the signal intensity time curve used for kinetics assessments. Time intensity curves and kinetics are not truly quantitative. Importantly, they vary according to the MR magnet, coil, contrast agent, pulse sequences, timing of post-contrast images and other factors. In addition, there is imperfect reproducibility in kinetics assignment for the same MRI lesions across computer-aided systems [3], and across radiologists [4].

Standard "full protocol" breast MRI examinations have at least two post-contrast series and typically include the following sequences:

- 3-plane localizer
- T2-weighted series (e.g., fluid sensitive T2 or STIR with sufficient T2-weighting to demonstrate fluid signal hyperintensity, for simplicity referred to as T2 in the remainder of this MRI section)
- 3) Non-contrast series without fat suppression, often T1-weighted
- T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) with one pre- and at least two post-contrast series

The DCE series are optimally viewed with fat removal to better demonstrate lesion enhancement. Fat removal may be achieved by acquiring the DCE MRI sequences with active fat suppression or by creation of separate subtracted series. Most U.S. practices achieve fat removal by active fat suppression on the acquired DCE sequences and also create post-processed subtraction images to remove non-enhancing structures. Alternatively, some practices do not perform active fat suppression and rely only on post-processed subtraction images for fat signal removal. Subtracted images can be impacted by patient motion between the sequences that are subtracted which can result in artifactual "pseudoenhancement," and radiologists should be alert to this potential artifact.</div>

There is no single definition for what constitutes an abbreviated MRI examination, but total scan times are usually less than 10 minutes. At minimum, a 3-plane localizer and a T1-weighted pre and single post-contrast series with or without active

fat suppression are included. Some protocols may also include a T2-weighted series. As with full protocol MRI, it is important to acquire an early post-contrast series 60–120 seconds after contrast at the time of maximum enhancement for most breast cancers and the largest contrast difference from background parenchymal enhancement.

Abbreviated MRI has been investigated and implemented at some sites as a tool for supplemental screening. There is ongoing research into whether abbreviated protocols are sufficient for other breast clinical indications.

Interpretation of abbreviated MRI is similar to that of a full protocol, but if only a single early post-contrast sequence is performed there is no delayed phase kinetics. Early post-contrast kinetics can still be assessed, as can even earlier kinetics if a "fast" or "ultrafast" protocol is being used.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Auditing <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments deserves mention here to minimize confusion about this new addition to the auditing process. Important points to remember include the following: 1) <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments are defined as those made at screening and those made at the initial round of diagnostic imaging, 2) for each patient, only the <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessment is counted in the denominator—subsequent BI-RADS category 3 assessments at follow-up intervals are not included, and 3) the recommended cancer ascertainment period is 2 years for total imaging surveillance of BI-RADS category 3 findings. A true-positive for an <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessment is thus defined as a breast cancer diagnosis occurring after an <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessment and during the BI-RADS category 3 cancer ascertainment period. Please refer to the text entitled "BI-RADS category 3 Auditing" under the *Basic Clinically Relevant Audit* (section II) for more details. The following example illustrates how to audit initial BI-RADS category 3 examinations correctly and incorrectly (Figure 5).

Twenty thousand screening mammograms were performed, and 2000 were assessed as BI-RADS category 0 with the recommendation for diagnostic imaging (see figure 5). No screening mammogram was given a BI-RADS category 3 (thus, this example refers to auditing of <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments at diagnostic imaging prompted by a BI-RADS category 0 screening examination). Of the 2000 recalled mammograms, initial diagnostic imaging for 100 was assessed as BI-RADS category 3, and the following outcomes were recorded for those 100 patients:

One patient was diagnosed with breast cancer after 6-month follow-up imaging was assessed as a BI-RADS category 4. This patient had 1 <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessment and no additional BI-RADS category 3 assessments.

Nine patients were assessed as BI-RADS category 2 at 6-month follow-up imaging that revealed decrease or resolution of the probably benign imaging finding. These 9 patients had 9 <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments and no additional BI-RADS category 3 assessments.

Ninety patients underwent follow-up imaging, and the findings were unchanged at 6, 12, and 24 months. They were given BI-RADS category 3 assessments at 6 and 12 months and were given BI-RADS category 2 assessments only at the 24-month examinations. These 90 patients had 90 initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments and 180 additional BI-RADS category 3 assessments (i.e., at 6 and 12 months).

                <div class="document-content">A specific subset of diagnostic breast MRI examinations is performed to assess the extent of breast cancer before definitive local treatment, usually surgery (note this does not include breast MRI examinations performed to evaluate response to neoadjuvant treatment; see the section on Magnetic Resonance Imaging for standard examination indications). Although not included in previous versions of the BI-RADS Atlas, new data provide initial audit metrics and benchmarks (Table 8) for performance of diagnostic breast MRI to evaluate the extent of disease (EOD). These benchmarks impact patient care because they provide a reference to gauge radiologist performance. Identification of additional sites of disease can guide appropriate surgical treatment decisions (e.g. mastectomy for multicentric disease). However, additional evaluation for abnormal findings seen on EOD breast MRI can also increase procedures, demand for limited resources, costs, and unnecessarily delay definitive treatment. Breast imaging teams that perform and interpret breast MRI are now encouraged to audit their practice in reference to these benchmarks to facilitate continuous quality improvement.

As described above, for the purposes of the audit, metrics and benchmarks reflect the predictive accuracy and interpretive performance of examination assessments rendered before the diagnosis of breast cancer at any location in either breast within a standard time interval. However, all breast MRI EOD examinations are performed after the diagnosis of breast cancer and will include a BI-RADS category 6 assessment, which, by definition, will exclude it from the audit (See What Not to Audit (section V. A.), page 849). Thus, to audit breast MRI EOD examinations, new definitions of positive and negative truth for individual findings, independent from the known cancer, are required.

- SPECIAL DEFINITIONS FOR DIAGNOSTIC EOD BREAST MRI
  - Standard Interval For auditing purposes, positive and negative truth are defined relative to the presence or absence of a tissue diagnosis of cancer for an individual finding

within a standard recommended interval of time after breast imaging examination. For diagnostic examinations, the interval to cancer diagnosis begins on the date of the diagnostic examination. The standard diagnostic interval is 1 year (365 days) as recommended by the ACR. Breast imaging facilities with an alternate accepted local standard interval, such as 2 years, whether in the United States or elsewhere, should consistently replace the 1-year interval with their standard interval.

- True-Positive (TP) There is tissue diagnosis of cancer for a positive finding (BI-RADS categories 4 or 5) within one standard ascertainment interval.
- c. False Positive (FP) There is no known tissue diagnosis of cancer for a positive *finding* (BI-RADS categories 4 or 5) within one standard ascertainment interval.
- d. True-Negative (TN) There is no known tissue diagnosis of cancer for a negative finding within one standard ascertainment interval.
- False-Negative (FN) There is tissue diagnosis of cancer for a negative finding within one standard ascertainment interval.</div>

The additional 12 months accommodate the standard ascertainment interval, which begins with the screening examination, and are needed for performance of diagnostic procedures (including biopsies), for collection of outcomes data, and to allow sufficient time for determination of cancer status (See page 813). For example, an audit conducted at the *end* of 2023 would involve examinations performed during calendar year 2022 plus the additional 12-month allowance for ascertainment of TN and FN interpretations. Subsequent audit analyses must be conducted at least once every 12 months, also involving the additional 12 months to produce meaningful audit outcomes.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>b</sup> Minimal breast cancer is invasive cancer ≤ 1 cm, or carcinoma in situ.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>c</sup> Sensitivity and specificity are measured with reasonable accuracy only if outcomes data are linked to breast cancer data in a regional tumor registry.

Data are typically collected and analyzed for 12-month periods. However, due to the random variation in the comparatively small number of cancers detected at screening in any individual practice audit and the demographic differences in patient populations served by individual practices, comparison of metrics from a single 12-month period with benchmark data may be less meaningful than assessing the trend of one's own performance over multiple 12-month intervals or assessing this trend in comparison to that of other members of the same practice. Moreover, for low-volume practices, and especially for individual interpreting physicians who work in low-volume practices, some metrics will lack precision and vary considerably from year to year because the number of cancers is small. An acceptable workaround, after the first-year audit is established, is to perform annual audits comprising data from the most recent 2, 3, or 4 years rather than just the most recent year [25]. For example, an audit analysis conducted at the end of 2023 may include data from 2020, 2021, and 2022; the following audit analysis at the end of 2024 may include data from 2021, 2022, and 2023, etc.

Whether data are being collected for the *Basic Clinically Relevant Audit* or for the *More Complete Audit* (section III) as outlined below, separate audit statistics should be maintained for screening and diagnostic examinations, as all the audit outcomes are significantly different [23, 24, 26–31]. However, some breast imaging practices may find it impractical or impossible to segregate screening from diagnostic examinations during an audit. In this situation, expected outcomes will vary depending on the relative contributions of screening and diagnostic examinations to the total. If the case mix can be estimated, simple mathematical modeling may be applied to combined screening and diagnostic audit data to derive suggested overall benchmark metrics [32].

Whether data are being collected for the *Basic Clinically Relevant Audit*, or for the *More Complete Audit* (section III) as outlined below, all audit data should be monitored for each interpreting physician and in the aggregate for the entire breast imaging facility.

Tissue diagnosis data for fine-needle aspiration cytology and core biopsy may be collected separately from surgical biopsy data but should be combined with surgical biopsy data for statistical calculations. Only biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes (benign versus malignant) should be counted. Surgical excisions performed to completely remove known cancer are not included in the audit.

Biopsy-proven histologies with an inherent risk of upgrade to DCIS, pleomorphic or florid LCIS, or invasive cancer, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, are negative for the purposes of the audit. If subsequent surgical excision is not performed within the standard ascertainment interval or it does not yield DCIS, pleomorphic or florid LCIS, or invasive cancer, the diagnostic examination is classified as FP. However, if excisional biopsy reveals DCIS, pleomorphic or florid LCIS, and/or invasive carcinoma, the diagnostic examination should be classified as a TP. Note that the diagnostic examination would still be classified as TP even if there were many biopsies within the standard interval and only one of them yielded a cancer diagnosis.

Note that pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (pLCIS) and florid lobular carcinoma in situ (fLCIS) have been newly added to the list of true-positive breast malignancies in the NMD and this revised version of the Manual (Table 3). The most recent benchmarks, updated for this version of the Manual, however, are based on data that did not include pLCIS or fLCIS as true-positive diagnoses (Tables 4, 5, 6 & 7). There are no other changes to the list of true-positive diagnoses. Malignant phyllodes tumor, breast sarcoma, metastases to the breast, lymphoma, leukemia, etc. are malignancies that occur within the breast but are not breast cancer (Table 3) and remain negative for the purposes of the audit.

Linkage of audit data with a regional or organizational tumor registry serving a captive, non-mobile patient population is uncommon but can provide FN and TN data to calculate sensitivity and specificity and facilitate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, a widely used approach to assess the important trade-offs between TP and FP outcomes. Most breast imaging facilities in the United States lack the resources and/or linkage to tumor registries to reliably ascertain complete

TN and FN results for their programs. Therefore, they cannot accurately calculate sensitivity or specificity nor does the MQSA Final Rule require it. For these practices, the NMD data provide the most appropriate and similar independent benchmarks [31]. Nevertheless, all breast imaging facilities may collect useful data on detected breast cancers (invasive cancer size, lymph node status, cancer stage), permitting successful evaluation of surrogate performance trade-offs assessed by ROC analysis. This alternative approach has the added benefit that tumor metrics may be more clinically relevant than sensitivity and specificity, because invasive cancer size, lymph node status, and breast cancer stage directly impact clinical cancer treatment. Furthermore, high sensitivity does not necessarily imply improved outcome. For example, sensitivity is consistently observed to be higher for mammography screening at 2-year intervals than at 1-year intervals, but this does not equate to improved outcomes. The longer interval allows breast cancers to grow and be more easily identified which raises sensitivity [33]. However, larger invasive breast cancers, more frequently positive lymph nodes, and later breast cancer stage at diagnosis equate to a poorer prognosis for patients.

The potential for under-ascertainment of true-positive examinations also exists. The MQSA Final Rule requires facilities to attempt to obtain histopathology results for mammography examinations for which tissue diagnosis is recommended. However, it may not be practical for some mammography facilities to identify as many breast cancers among positive examinations as are identified by facilities participating in the BCSC or other linkage to a tumor registry. Therefore, BCSC benchmarks, listed above in Tables 4 and 7, that depend on breast cancer ascertainment, especially breast cancer detection rate, will likely exceed the performance calculated for a screening facility without a registry linkage. The potential for under-ascertainment of true-positive examinations is higher for US and MRI because the FDA regulations [1] do not require breast imaging facilities to attempt to obtain tissue diagnosis results for US or MRI examinations for which tissue diagnosis is recommended.

Breast imaging practices that record only overall BI-RADS assessments for combined diagnostic mammography/US examinations performed concurrently should expect outcomes that are different from published benchmarks, which involve the performance of diagnostic mammography alone. Currently there are only sparse published data to guide benchmarks for overall mammography/US examinations performed concurrently. By recording separate assessments for the mammography and US components as well as the overall assessment, facilities may derive outcomes for each component examination as well as for the overall combined) examination. The same statements in this paragraph also apply to overall BI-RADS assessments made for other combinations of diagnostic breast imaging examinations performed concurrently (mammography/MRI and US/MRI and mammography/US/MRI).</div>

                <div class="document-content">The discussion on lymph nodes has been greatly expanding in this version. Nearly all breast cancers metastasize via the lymphatic system, and nodal staging is an important component determining the overall cancer stage. Importantly, cancer stage determines prognosis and dictates treatment. Therefore, accurate nodal staging is vital to optimal patient care. Surgical nodal staging historically has been the gold standard. In recent years, imaging is playing an increasingly important role in nodal staging, particularly as neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly administered to downstage disease (including nodal disease) before surgery. Additionally, surgical nodal staging, even with extensive axillary lymph node dissection, generally evaluates only the axillary levels I and II, but not level III, internal mammary chain, or the supraclavicular space.

Ultrasound is an excellent modality for assessing the morphology of the individual node. As the node becomes invaded by tumor, morphological changes in the node can be seen, including alterations in the cortical-hilar relationship. The published literature in breast ultrasound has shown that cortical thickening of > 3 mm raises concern for metastatic nodal involvement. This version discusses not only nodal morphology (both normal and abnormal), but also the anatomic regions that comprise the N stage of TNM staging. For the first time in BI-RADS, the three levels of the axilla will be detailed, with the pectoralis minor muscle as the landmark in anatomic delineation. The internal mammary chain node may also be imaged with ultrasound, as can supraclavicular nodes. Ultrasound is unique as a modality in that it may readily image all the regional nodal basins in breast cancer, as well as serve as a means to guide biopsy for definitive tissue diagnosis of malignancy and provide information regarding biomarkers.

Enhancing masses are characterized morphologically by shape, margin, and internal enhancement pattern after administration of contrast. These enhancement features should be assessed on the early post-contrast series. For some masses, signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences may also be useful. Enhancement kinetics may also help characterize MRI masses for which the morphology is not definitively benign or suspicious.

Not all mass features must be used in describing a mass. In general, the description of a mass should include at least shape and margin. When they influence assessment, internal enhancement and/or T2 signal intensity and/or kinetics should also be described.

Of MRI features, the following are more frequently associated with benign outcomes, but malignancies can also have these features, and combinations of features must be considered.

- · Oval shape
- · Circumscribed margin
- · Homogeneous internal enhancement
- T2 hyperintensity, if also oval and circumscribed and with homogeneous internal enhancement
  or dark internal septations. Based on the existing data and expert practice, a mass with all of
  these features has a likelihood of cancer ≤ 2% [4]

The answer to this question is analogous to that provided in the previous discussion concerning double reading. When two radiologists interpret one or more examinations for the same patient, each radiologist should assume separate responsibility for the examination(s) that they interpret. If a screening and a diagnostic examination are each interpreted as positive, and there is a subsequent diagnosis of breast cancer within 1 year, then both the screening and diagnostic examinations are classified as *true-positive (TP)*, and each radiologist gets credit for their interpretation.</div>

                <div class="document-content">1. Why are handheld ultrasound screening (HHUS) examinations audited using an approach like that for mammography?

As explained in the Introduction to the Auditing and Outcomes Monitoring section, auditing must be based on objective and reproducible rules. Furthermore, auditing for all breast imaging modalities should utilize the same rules to facilitate cross-modality comparisons, except when the unique aspects of a given modality justify a different approach. Auditing procedures for mammography have been established for many years and clinically representative benchmarks using these auditing procedures have been published, so that an

individual mammography facility (or individual interpreting physician) may reliably compare observed outcomes with these benchmarks. The use of US and MRI for both screening and diagnostic breast imaging has become widespread. It is not only reasonable but also highly desirable to base the auditing of US and MRI examinations on the procedures used for mammography, whenever practical.

In defining positive screening examinations, mammography, US and MRI auditing utilize the objective and reproducible rule of whether action, such as acquiring additional images beyond the standard screening protocol or tissue sampling, is recommended by the interpreting radiologist and/or performed before completion of the standard screening interval. This rule is also applied to HHUS and ABUS auditing when the radiologist directs additional (nonstandard) sonographic image acquisition to further characterize findings at the time of HHUS or ABUS examinations. Each breast imaging facility is encouraged to adhere to the ACR Practice Parameter for Performance of Whole Breast Ultrasound for Screening and Staging. Facilities that deviate from the practice parameter should indicate in their policy and procedure manual what standard images should be recorded for normal (BI-RADS category 1 or 2) HHUS or ABUS examinations. Furthermore, the HHUS or ABUS report should indicate if standard screening images were permanently archived with or without additional, nonstandard (i.e. diagnostic) images. This will allow for objective and reproducible auditing, especially if HHUS or ABUS reports are created using an automated system to prospectively identify examinations with additional permanently archived diagnostic images as screening-positive and either diagnostic-positive or diagnostic-negative depending on the final assessment rendered.

2. I do not understand why BI-RADS assessment category 3 is not recommended at screening for mammography but acceptable for US. Why this difference in recommendations?

BI-RADS assessment category 3 is not recommended at screening for mammography because a full diagnostic breast imaging work-up should be completed before rendering a category 3 assessment. This practice complies with the prospective data supporting the observation of specific findings when a diagnostic examination is completed [44]. There are two relevant scenarios for allowing a BI-RADS 3 related to screening US. During online screening, the interpreting radiologist may acquire or direct the sonographer to acquire additional images to further evaluate a finding. These additional images create a diagnostic examination and qualify the screening examination as BI-RADS assessment category 0 because action is taken before completing the next standard screening ascertainment interval. The imaging work-up is completed contemporaneously and the diagnostic examination assessed as BI-RADS category 3. The screening examination would be audited as positive (category 0) while the diagnostic examination would be audited as negative (if category 3) or positive (if category 4 or 5). If audited correctly as above, the patient appropriately receives a BI-RADS 3 assessment for the diagnostic examination acquired during the screening visit, A BI-RADS 3 may also be rendered for a screening US examination without completing a diagnostic work-up as described in the literature [45].</div>

# VI. GUIDANCE

Many substantive changes were incorporated into the current version to reflect new data, improve the clinical utility of the BI-RADS Manual and supply a unified base for research involving breast imaging. This chapter expands on these changes as they appear in each section of the BI-RADS Manual and provides more complete explanations for the changes. What follows is intended for guidance and is not meant to imply required standards of practice.</div>

MOD Category S includes imaging-based screening examinations performed specifically to detect breast cancer in an *asymptomatic* population. Screening involves the binary decision of recommending action before the next screening versus recommending no action until the next screening. When the initial finding of a possible breast cancer is detected on an image-based screening examination and additional action is recommended (i.e. BI-RADS category 0, 3, 4 or 5), that leads to a diagnosis of breast cancer, the MOD is category S. Subcategories are defined so that the first specific screening modality allowing the radiologist to detect the cancer can be captured and abstracted.

Category S: initial asymptomatic image-based screening detection

- Category Sma: screening full field 2D film or FFDM (no synthetic views or DBT)
- · Category Sdbt: screening with DBT plus FFDM, synthetic 2D or both

- · Category Sus: screening ultrasound
- Category Smri: screening MRI
- · Category Scem: screening contrast enhanced mammography
- Category Snuc: screening Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) or Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI)
- Category So: other screening modality (CT, etc.)</div>

If previous examinations do not become available within 30 days, FDA regulation requires a new final assessment category be assigned as if the examination were a baseline study. The second interpretation replaces and supersedes the initial interpretation and is used for audit purposes.

This situation is analogous to the screening examination assessed as incomplete (BI-RADS category 0) awaiting prior examination(s) for comparison. Final assessment of the diagnostic examination and management recommendation are deferred until the imaging evaluation is completed, at which time the initial BI-RADS category 0 assessment is *replaced* by a final (category 1–5) assessment. The initial BI-RADS category 0 assessment is not included in the audit as it is a temporary placeholder until a definitive final assessment is rendered. Note that only the second final assessment is used for audit purposes, regardless of whether the initial assessment was read by the same or different reader.

                <div class="document-content">- 7. A patient has a diagnostic breast imaging examination because of a clinically suspicious lump. This diagnostic examination is assessed as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) with a recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging. A biopsy of the area of clinical suspicion is performed within 1 year and the result is invasive ductal carcinoma. For the purposes of the audit, an initial BI-RADS category 3 assigned at diagnostic imaging is negative. Because malignancy is diagnosed within 1 year, this examination is classified as false-negative (FN).
- 8. A patient has a screening examination and is recalled for additional imaging evaluation of a finding (BI-RADS category 0). The diagnostic breast imaging examination is read as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) with a recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging. At 6 months, the second diagnostic examination shows a change, and tissue diagnosis is recommended (BI-RADS category 4). Malignancy is found. The screening interpretation is positive (BI-RADS category 0). The first diagnostic interpretation is negative (BI-RADS category 4). Breast cancer

- indeed is diagnosed within 1 year of all three examinations. Thus, for the purposes of the general audit, the *screening* examination is classified as *true-positive (TP)*, the *first diagnostic* examination is classified as *false-negative (FN)*, and the *second diagnostic* examination is classified as *true-positive (TP)*.
- 9. A patient has a screening examination and is recalled for additional imaging evaluation of a finding (BI-RADS category 0). The diagnostic breast imaging examination is read as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) with a recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging. At 6 months, the second diagnostic examination shows a change, and tissue diagnosis is recommended (BI-RADS category 4). The biopsy result is concordantly benign, and no breast cancer is found within 1 year of the follow-up examination. Thus, the screening interpretation is positive, the first diagnostic interpretation is negative, and the second (6-month) diagnostic interpretation is positive. Because no breast cancer is found within 1 year of any of the examinations, for the general audit, the screening interpretation is classified as false-positive (FP), the first diagnostic interpretation is classified as true-negative (TN), and the second diagnostic interpretation is classified as false-positive (FP).
- 10. A patient has a screening examination and is recalled for additional imaging evaluation of a finding (BI-RADS category 0). The diagnostic breast imaging examination is performed a few days later and is interpreted as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) with a recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging. At 6 months, the second diagnostic examination shows no change, and again is read as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) with a recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging. The patient returns for the next examination 7 months later, at which time a change is seen, tissue diagnosis is recommended (BI-RADS category 4), and malignancy is found. Thus, the screening interpretation is positive, the first diagnostic interpretation immediately following the screening examination is negative, the second (6-month) diagnostic examination is negative and the last (13-month) diagnostic interpretation is positive. Because no breast cancer is found within 1 year of the screening examination and the first diagnostic examination, these are classified as falsepositive (FP) and true-negative (TN), respectively for the purposes of the basic audit. Because breast cancer indeed is diagnosed within 1 year of the second (6-month) examination and the last (13-month) examination, these are classified as false-negative (FN) and true-positive (TP), respectively. See also above Section II, The Basic Clinically Relevant Audit on page 816, BI-RADS Category 3 Auditing, page 822 and see below Section C, Auditing of Initial BI-RADS Category 3 Assessments, page 846.
- 11. A patient has a mammography screening examination that is assessed as probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) with a recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging, despite the guidance provided in the BI-RADS Manual not to use category 3 assessments at mammography screening. At 6 months, diagnostic breast imaging examination shows the finding to be characteristically benign, resulting in a BI-RADS category 2 assessment. No breast cancer is diagnosed within 1 year of the screening examination. The screening assessment is positive (additional imaging recommended prior to next interval screening) and the diagnostic assessment is negative. Because no cancer is diagnosed within 1 year, the screening examination is classified as false-positive (FP) and the diagnostic examination is classified as true-negative (TN). Note that proper classification of BI-RADS category 3 screening assessments as positive interpretations will not lower the recall rate (aka abnormal interpretation rate). In the clinical scenario illustrated here, the only effect of using a BI-RADS category 3 assessment at screening is a 6-month delay in the diagnostic breast imaging examination that results in a definitively benign diagnosis, thereby prolonging the period of uncertainty for the radiologist and the patient.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">Significant findings on the LE and RC images should be reported and correlated. If there is an abnormality on the LE images, a statement as to whether it is seen on the RC images and vice versa should be included. When there is a finding on the LE images, descriptors using the mammography lexicon should be used. When there is a finding on the RC images descriptors as outlined in the CEM lexicon section should be used. If the finding is present on both the LE and RC images, descriptors of both using the lexicon should be reported.

Abnormal enhancement is unique and separate from BPE. Its description should indicate the breast in which the abnormal enhancement occurs, the lesion type, and modifiers.

The report of any significant finding should include:

- a. Size of finding
- b. Location
  - i. Laterality should be indicated.
  - ii. Location- Quadrant and/or clock face should be reported. Quadrants refer to smaller sub-divisions of the breast, including upper outer, upper inner, lower outer, and lower inner portions of the breast. Some additional location descriptors that do not conform to a quadrant include central (deep to the nipple on all views, middle to posterior depth), retroareolar (deep to the nipple on all views, anterior depth), axillary tail

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>1</sup>In July 2025, the FDA approved an alternative standard that would allow the interpreting physician to provide an overall assessment of breast density that is phrased in the singular phrasing. The singular phrasing is intended to be used in reports of unilateral mammograms. Please see the Mammography Guidance section #10 for more information.

(upper outer quadrant adjacent to axilla), and axilla. Clock face is oriented based on the patient facing the observer and should be specified using a whole number. For example, 3:00 is in the lateral left breast and the medial right breast. For some large one-view findings, it may not be possible to specify a quadrant or clock face. In these situations, a hemisphere descriptor should be used: upper, lower, inner, or outer.

iii. Depth or distance from the nipple - Describe the location based on depth (anterior, middle, posterior) or distance from the nipple in whole centimeters (e.g., 2 cm from the nipple, not 2.3 cm from the nipple). Using smaller distance increments implies a higher level of precision than is possible across readers and modalities. If findings are between whole cm locations, the closest whole cm location should be selected and used.

Measure the distance from the nipple from the base of the nipple to the center of the finding, on the same image if both are visible. If the finding is close to the nipple, it is important to describe how far the anterior extent of the imaging finding is from the nipple to assist with surgical planning. If the finding is large, distance to its anterior and posterior extents can also be included, to assist with surgical planning.

If the findings are close to the skin, pectoralis muscle or chest wall, describe the distance of the findings to these structures. Due to differences in patient positioning and other technique factors, distance from the nipple, skin, pectoralis muscle and chest wall may vary across modalities. It may be helpful to describe the anatomic zone where the finding lies to facilitate lesion identification when correlating among modalities. For example, noting that a mass lies at the subcutaneous fat-fibroglandular zone junction may allow easier search and more confident identification when ultrasound evaluation is undertaken.

- c. Descriptors for abnormal enhancement. If a mass is seen on both the LE and RC images, the shape and margin should be described using the mammography lexicon. Repeating the descriptors for the findings on the RC image is not necessary.
  - i. Mass
    - · Shape (if seen on RC image only)
    - · Margin if evaluable (if seen on RC image only)
    - · Internal characteristics, if evaluable
    - · Lesion conspicuity
  - ii. Non-mass
    - Distribution
    - · Internal characteristics, if evaluable
    - Lesion conspicuity
  - iii. Enhancing asymmetry
    - · Lesion conspicuity
- Artifacts if severe enough to potentially affect interpretation</div>

                <div class="document-content">When more than one type of imaging modality examination is performed concurrently (on the same day), it is preferable that the examinations be reported together. To facilitate coding and billing, the exam findings for each imaging modality should be described in separate paragraphs. The assessment should be unified into an overall assessment with combined management recommendations that incorporate conclusions from all imaging modalities. In general, when the assessments for two examinations differ, the overall assessment (and concordant management recommendations) should reflect the more abnormal of the individual assessments (unless a category 0 assessment has been resolved as benign by the additional same-day imaging). Such prioritization of the overall assessment will ensure that the more time-sensitive management actions occur sooner. The following hierarchy of decreasing abnormality should be used as a general guide, where the most abnormal assessment (category 5) takes precedence over the less abnormal assessments: category 5, 4, 0, 6, 3, 2, 1 (Table 6).

Table 6. Abnormality Hierarchy

Exceptions to this rule occur when the characteristically benign features of a given finding on one imaging modality supersedes the less specifically benign features of the same finding on the other examination. For example, an oval, circumscribed mass at mammography is not specifically benign, but if concurrent US characterizes this same mass as a simple cyst, the mass may be assessed as benign (category 2). There is an exception to this rule with breast MRI. Breast MRI exams are often performed and interpreted separately from other diagnostic breast imaging modalities, sometimes by different radiologists.</div>

Park et al [32] reported that 12.5% of the malignant non-mass lesions in their study were associated with nipple discharge, and 9.1% with palpability. There was no statistically significant correlation in malignant non-mass lesions with patient age or mammographic density.</div>

                <div class="document-content">When there are multiple cysts, representative images suffice. When several cysts are present, it is not necessary to document every cyst in two views; measuring the largest in each breast along only its longest axis is sufficient. If the US examination is directed to a specific mammographic abnormality or if the cyst corresponds to an area of clinical concern to the patient, physician, or other health care provider, its measurements should be recorded in three dimensions. However, if a solitary asymptomatic simple cyst is identified at screening US, then documentation depends on whether or not the radiologist chooses to include it as a finding in the report. One image along the longest axis of the cyst is sufficient if the cyst is described in the report (benign assessment). No imaging documentation is required if the cyst is not described in the report (negative assessment).

Although cysts can occur high in the axillary tail location or in accessory breast tissue within the axilla, such a location should suggest other etiologies, such as metastatic lymph nodes. Color or power Doppler and some elastography methods can offer confirmation of the circumscribed, anechoic mass as a simple cyst.

Similar guidance is pertinent for the documentation of intramammary lymph node(s). If the US examination is directed to a mammographic abnormality or if the node corresponds to an area of clinical concern to the patient, physician, or other health care provider, full documentation of the lymph node is appropriate. However, an asymptomatic, characteristically benign, intramammary lymph node, fully evaluated at real-time scanning or observed incidentally, does not require documentation.

For US, as for mammography, benign (category 2) is the appropriate assessment for multiple bilateral solid circumscribed masses, as long as all the masses are similar and typically benign in appearance [11, 12]. If the interpreting physician prefers to document all masses rather than just the largest in each quadrant or in each breast, reporting should be in the form of a list including clock-face locations of the masses, distance from the nipple, and three orthogonal measurements. When there are numerous masses in the same area, reporting the depth from the skin to the center of a lesion also helps to differentiate it from others, assuming such detailed documentation is indicated and desired. (Please refer to Audit and Outcomes Monitoring section regarding the effect of permanent archival of nonstandard images on the audit of screening examinations.)

Figure 1 - DOCUMENTATION: MULTIPLE MASSES. Coronal views of the right (A) and left (B) breasts obtained with automated US show numerous circumscribed masses bilaterally. The transverse or axial acquisition is shown at the top right of (B) with the sagittal reconstruction at the lower right. Crosshairs correlate with lesion location on the three views. Diagrams and annotation at the lower corners of the coronal views indicate distance from the nipple, clock-face notation, and depth from the skin to the center of the crosshairs. Documentation in a list is efficient and clear.

# E. HANDHELD VS. AUTOMATED AND PHYSICIAN- VS. TECHNOLOGIST-PERFORMED

The limitations of mammography in patients with dense breast tissue have led to a dramatic increase in the use of ultrasound in the last decade. In the 2024 the use of whole-breast ultrasound as an adjunct screening tool can be considered for women with heterogeneously or extremely dense breast tissue, women with a high lifetime breast cancer risk (20% or greater) who are not candidates for breast MRI or those women at high risk who cannot easily access breast MRI [13]. Several multi-institutional and prospective trials such as the ACRIN 6666, J-START and ASTOUND study conclude the use of supplemental ultrasound screening improves the detection of small, node negative invasive breast cancers compared to mammography alone in women with dense breast tissue, albeit associated with an increase in the number of false-positives [14–16].

The implementation of a screening ultrasound program is dependent on the dedicated resources and availability of extra space and personnel (trained technologist and interpreting physician) at each institution. Supplemental screening with handheld ultrasound allows for continued use of existing equipment, as opposed to fully or semi-automated screening ultrasound systems that require specialized transducers (15 cm linear/curved array or ring-shaped) with or without the use of a water bath.

According to the ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of Whole-Breast Ultrasound for Screening and Staging [13] documentation of a standard HHUS screening exam requires a minimum recording of one image from each quadrant and one image behind the nipple. Automated systems record the images during the acquisition process for later interpretation by the physician. The storage of the entire exam facilitates the decoupling of exam interpretation and image acquisition.

Handheld ultrasound can be performed by either the interpreting physician or the technologist. In a review published in 2019 [17], there were similar outcomes between screening ultrasound exams performed by a technologist, and those conducted by a physician. The average incremental cancer detection rate (CDR) across 361,502 physician performed screening ultrasound exams was 2.0 per 1000 women screened, comparable to the 2.7 cancers diagnosed per 1000 women screened in 64,018 technologists performed screening ultrasound exams. In the same review, the CDR was 2.5 per 1000 screens performed across 27,163 automated or semi-automated exams.

Some PACS and automated ultrasound systems can reconstruct the data in multiple planes to improve lesion characterization. The 3D automated ultrasound platform can generate a coronal image which has the potential to enhance a pattern of architectural distortion associated with malignancy. This finding, when seen on the reconstructed coronal view, is unique and highly predictive of malignancy [18]. The pattern appears as radiating hypoechoic lines perpendicular to and converging on a central hypoechoic mass and is thought to represent tumor infiltration (hypoechoic lines) into the adjacent tissue. Accompanying this finding is a surrounding echogenic rind which represents the adjacent desmoplastic reaction. The rind can be quite variable in its conspicuity.

**Figure 1** – AUTOMATED SCREENING ULTRASOUND. Retraction phenomenon. Patient with dense breast tissue had supplemental screening with ultrasound. The consecutive 3D reconstructed coronal images demonstrate a hypoechoic irregular mass with surrounding echogenic rind and architectural distortion. The retraction associated with the echogenic rind (arrows) is highly predictive for malignancy.

**Figure 2** – AUTOMATED SCREENING ULTRASOUND: 3D reconstructed coronal image (A) demonstrates a hypoechoic mass identified in the middle of the crosshairs. The corresponding axial transverse EFOV image (B) demonstrates a microlobulated hypoechoic mass with no posterior acoustic features. Pathology: Intermediate grade invasive ductal carcinoma.

A BI-RADS assessment category 0 is recommended for any suspicious or indeterminate finding identified on an automated or HHUS screening study that requires further diagnostic workup. A patient may undergo further workup with focused handheld ultrasound on the same day; however, the latter is considered to be a diagnostic exam and both exams require separate final assessment codes for the purpose of the audit. The interpreting physician may choose to dictate each exam under one report and give an overall final recommendation. Separate BI-RADS assessment categories for the screening and diagnostic ultrasound evaluation help with outcomes monitoring and auditing. Only BI-RADS assessment codes 0, 1, or 2 should be assigned to screening ultrasound examinations, and only after a diagnostic evaluation should a BI-RADS assessment code of 3, 4, or 5 be given.

# A. TISSUE COMPOSITION

The wide normal variability in tissue composition seen on mammograms can also be observed on US images. The sonographic echo pattern of the breast depends on the distinct composition of the breast elements within the fibroglandular zone. The fibroglandular zone is located between the subcutaneous and retromammary fat and is comprised of various glandular elements (the milk ducts, the terminal duct lobular units) and stromal fibrous tissue. Unlike mammography, where the density of stromal and glandular elements is similar, ultrasound can differentiate the hypoechoic glandular elements from the hyperechoic stromal background. Based on the tissue composition, there are three basic tissue patterns: Homogeneous background echotexture-fat, homogeneous background echotexture-fibroglandular, and heterogeneous background echotexture.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Is the person who interpreted the initial examination as negative charged with a false-negative (FN), or is the person who detected the cancer at the 'early" second screening examination credited with a true-positive (TP)?

The answer is both. Because the first screening examination was interpreted as negative, but breast cancer was diagnosed within 1 year, this examination is classified as *false-negative (FN)*. Because the second screening examination was read as positive and breast cancer was diagnosed shortly thereafter, this examination is classified as *true-positive (TP)*.

For purposes of the audits of the two individual radiologists, each will assume responsibility for their individual assessment, the first radiologist for a *false-negative (FN)* interpretation, and the second radiologist for a *true-positive (TP)* interpretation.

It may appear to be unfair that the first radiologist is assigned a *false-negative (FN)* outcome when the only reason for this outcome is that the patient returned for screening sufficiently early that a breast cancer diagnosis was made less than 1 year after the previous examination. However, this scenario is rare and requires auditing rules to be consistently and uniformly applied to produce meaningful overall results. Therefore, subjectivity must be eliminated from

the process of determining outcomes, such as allowing one to decide whether what appears to be a *false-negative (FN)* outcome is the result of early subsequent screening (one then would need to examine the previous screening examination in retrospect to decide whether it should or should not have been interpreted as negative) or interpretive error.</div>

                <div class="document-content">There is continued interest in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), a non-contrast MRI technique that can augment DCE information including distinguishing benign from malignant findings. DWI measures the mobility of water molecules within tissue, reflecting the cellular microenvironment. Breast cancers typically demonstrate reduced water diffusivity relative to normal and benign tissue.

For DWI, motion-sensitizing gradients are applied during image acquisition, and the DW signal intensity is proportional to water mobility within a voxel. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is the rate of diffusion defined as the average area occupied by a water molecule per unit time (in mm²/second). ADC values are calculated using image acquisitions at two or more different b-values. The b-value reflects the strength and timing of the imaging gradients used to generate diffusion-weighted images. The higher the b-value, the stronger the diffusion effects. ADC values quantitatively reflect a composite of tissue factors affecting net water mobility in each voxel including microcirculation, cellular density, organization, and membrane integrity. Requirements for DWI of the breast include specification of b values (typically 0 and 800 with additional higher b-values optional), repetition and echo times, spatial resolution and fat removal.

Because breast cancers typically exhibit hindered water diffusion, they exhibit higher DWI signal on high b-value images and lower ADC values compared with normal and benign breast tissue. DWI information has been shown to complement DCE MRI to help distinguish between benign and malignant findings to decrease unnecessary biopsies, predict and monitor response to neo-adjuvant therapy, and stratify ductal carcinoma in situ from invasive disease. There is ongoing research for use of DWI as a component of non-contrast MRI protocols for screening.

Guidelines for reporting DWI findings are not a component of BI-RADS at this time. The Breast MRI DWI international working group statement [5] classification system may be used, categorizing diffusion level as very low, low, intermediate, high, and very high. Due to the promise of DWI, it is anticipated that a BI-RADS working group will be convened to create a DWI lexicon supplement to the Breast MRI section.</div>

                <div class="document-content">I do not understand why BI-RADS assessment category 3 is not recommended at screening for mammography but accepted for screening MRI. Also, I see that a screening category 3 assessment should be considered positive, regardless of the modality. Why the differences in recommendations for use and why the similarity in how to audit screening category 3 assessments?

The first part of the answer is that data specifying the features of BI-RADS category 3 findings for mammography are well established and require complete diagnostic evaluation. However, the specific features of MRI findings that may be safely followed with a likelihood

of malignancy of 2% or less are neither definitively established nor differentiated by screening or diagnostic MRI protocols. Facilities currently elect whether or not to assess BI-RADS category 3 assessments at screening MRI at their discretion. The second part of the answer recognizes the differences between MRI and mammography. Screening and diagnostic mammography examinations are distinctly different, with additional specific and targeted images being obtained during diagnostic mammography. Both screening MRI and diagnostic MRI examinations likely contain all the imaging information required for interpretation without the need for added sequences. Hence, a category 3 assessment at screening MRI is acceptable, as the finding in question has been fully evaluated prior to rendering the assessment. The third part of the answer is that a BI-RADS category 3 assessment at screening is considered positive at auditing, independent of screening modality, because the management recommendation (short-interval follow-up) includes action before completion of the standard screening interval of 1 year.

                <div class="document-content">Non-mass enhancement (NME) is a unique area of enhancement that is distinct from normal background enhancement and is not a mass. NME may extend over small or large areas and often has interspersed areas of FGT or fat between the enhancing components. When deciding to characterize enhancement as a mass or NME, intervening tissue and/or fat or NME-type distribution pattern suggest the enhancement may be better described as NME.

NME is characterized morphologically by distribution and internal enhancement pattern. These enhancement features should be assessed on the early post-contrast series. Kinetics may also help characterize NME for which the morphology is not definitively benign or suspicious.

Not all non-mass enhancement features must be used in describing NME. In general, the description should include at least distribution and internal enhancement. When they influence assessment, enhancement kinetics should also be described.</div>

                <div class="document-content">- A. Raw data to be collected
  - Modality or modalities.
  - Dates of audit period and total number of examinations in that period.
  - Number of screening examinations; number of diagnostic examinations (separate audit statistics should be maintained for each).
  - Number of ACR BI-RADS category 0 assessments "Need additional imaging evaluation."
  - 5. Number of ACR BI-RADS category 3 assessments "Probably benign."
  - Number of ACR BI-RADS category 4 assessments "Suspicious" and category 5 assessments — "Highly suggestive of malignancy."
  - 7. Tissue diagnosis results: positive or negative, for all ACR BI-RADS category 0, 3, 4 and 5 assessments (ACR suggests that you keep separate data for fine-needle aspiration/core biopsy cases and for surgical biopsy cases). MQSA Final Rule requires that an attempt is made to collect tissue diagnosis results for those mammography examinations for which tissue diagnosis is recommended [1].
  - 8. Cancer staging: histologic type, invasive cancer size (single largest dimension), nodal status, tumor grade, and biomarker status when available.
  - MQSA Final Rule also requires analysis of any known false-negative mammography examinations by attempting to obtain surgical and/or pathology results and by review of false-negative mammography examinations [1].

- B. Derived data to be calculated
  - True-positives (TP)
  - False-positives (FP<sub>1</sub>, FP<sub>2</sub>, FP<sub>3</sub>)
  - Positive predictive value (PPV<sub>1</sub>, PPV<sub>2</sub>, PPV<sub>3</sub>)
    - a. In a screening/diagnostic facility, PPV may be obtained in one or more of three ways:
      - 1. PPV<sub>1</sub> denominator includes all cases at screening examination recommended for anything other than breast cancer screening (BI-RADS categories 0, 3, 4, 5)
      - 2. PPV<sub>2</sub> denominator includes all cases recommended for tissue diagnosis procedure (BI-RADS categories 4, 5)
      - 3. PPV<sub>3</sub> denominator includes all cases of tissue diagnosis procedures performed, otherwise known as biopsy yield of malignancy or positive biopsy rate (PBR)
    - If screening exclusively, obtain in only one way: PPV<sub>1</sub> based on "positive" cases at screening examination, which includes recommendation for anything other than breast cancer screening (BI-RADS categories 0, 3, 4, 5)
  - 4. Breast cancer detection rate
  - 5. Percentage of invasive breast cancers that are node-negative
  - Percentage of breast cancers that are "minimal" (minimal cancer is defined as invasive cancer ≤ 1 cm, or ductal carcinoma in-situ or pleiomorphic or florid lobular carcinoma in-situ of any size)
  - Percentage of breast cancers that are stage 0 or I
  - 8. Abnormal interpretation rate (aka recall rate) for screening examinations
  - Outcomes for <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments (new to the BI-RADS v2025 Manual, see text below)
    - a. Frequency of initial BI-RADS category 3 assessments
    - Percentage of screening examinations that result in an initial BI-RADS category 3
      assessment at diagnostic imaging (calculated for screening examinations only)
    - c. Percentage of <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments that result in a breast cancer diagnosis

Collection and calculation of all the data in the *Basic Clinically Relevant Audit* requires proper coding of the data elements for efficient retrieval, often requiring considerable effort. However, once collected and calculated, these data allow clinically relevant measurement of one's practice outcomes by providing quantifiable evidence in pursuit of the three major goals of breast cancer screening:

- Find a high percentage of breast cancers that exist in a screening population (measurement: cancer detection rate).
- Find these breast cancers within an acceptable range of recommendations for additional imaging and recommendations for tissue diagnosis, to minimize cost and morbidity (measurement: recall rate, abnormal interpretation rate, positive predictive values).
- Find a high percentage of small, node-negative, early-stage breast cancers, which are more likely to be curable (measurement: percentages of node-negative, minimal, and stage 0 + I cancers).</div>

Self-examination and clinical breast examination (CBE), which detect lumps, thickening or tenderness, can also be the initial MOD leading to a diagnosis. Patients may also trigger detection of breast cancer when they seek care for nipple discharge, erythema, pain, dimpling or skin ulceration. In addition, other imaging or laboratory tests not designed to evaluate the breast, such as abdominal CT or brain MRI, may also offer the initial findings of metastases that lead to a diagnosis of breast cancer.</div>

Using smaller distance increments implies a higher level of precision than is possible across readers and modalities. If findings are between whole cm locations, the closest whole cm location should be selected and used.

Measure the distance from the nipple from the base of the nipple to the center of the finding, on the same image if both are visible. If the finding is close to the nipple, it is important to describe how far the anterior extent of the imaging finding is from the nipple to assist with surgical planning. If the finding is large, distance to its anterior and posterior extents can also be included, to assist with surgical planning. If the findings are close to the skin, pectoralis muscle or chest wall, describe the distance of the findings to these structures.

Due to differences in patient positioning and other technique factors, distance from the nipple, skin, pectoralis muscle and chest wall may vary across modalities.

It may be helpful to describe the anatomic zone where the finding lies to facilitate lesion identification when correlating among modalities. For example, noting that a mass lies at the subcutaneous fat-fibroglandular zone junction may allow for more efficient search and more confident identification when ultrasound evaluation is undertaken.

Using smaller subcentimeter distance increments implies a higher level of precision than is possible across readers and modalities.

Measure the distance from the nipple from the base of the nipple to the center of the finding, on the same 2-dimensional (2D) image if both are visible or using a maximum intensity projection if both are not visible on the same 2D image. If the finding is close to the nipple, it is important to also describe the distance from its anterior extent to the nipple, to assist with surgical planning.

Breast MRI for implant assessment is typically performed in patients with silicone implants who have signs or symptoms, to evaluate for rupture or other complication. In the U.S. the FDA also recommends that asymptomatic patients with silicone implants undergo imaging to detect "silent rupture," using ultrasound or MRI, 5–6 years after placement, then every 2–3 years [13]. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria now has similar recommendations for imaging asymptomatic patients with silicone implants for "silent rupture". However, a study of U.S. plastic surgeons in 2020 found that most did not recommend imaging in this scenario [14].

Breast MRI performed only for assessment of implants does not require contrast. If only a non-contrast examination intentionally is performed, no BI-RADS assessment is given. This is because BI-RADS assessments reflect probabilities of breast cancer, and at this time detection of breast cancer requires contrast.

The MRI technique for silicone implants should include both T2-weighted images to assess for perimplant fluid and silicone-specific sequences to assess for implant integrity. Silicone-specific sequences suppress both water and fat (both appear dark) so that only silicone appears hyperintense, allowing evaluation of the silicone implant without bright signal from water or fat.</div>

                <div class="document-content">With advances in equipment capabilities and knowledge of breast ultrasonography, there is increasing awareness and identification of sonographic findings and abnormalities that do not meet the criteria of a mass. A mass is a space-occupying lesion seen in at least 2 different planes. It is important to recognize that some important sonographic findings do not meet the criteria for, and may lack conspicuity of, a mass but may still represent malignancy.

The concept of such a sonographic lesion was introduced by Uematsu et al in 2012 [30], and they classified such findings as either ductal hypoechoic areas or non-ductal hypoechoic areas. Since that time, various terminologies have been used, including non-mass like lesion, non-mass lesion, non-mass image-forming lesion, ductal changes, duct-like structures, and focal shadowing [31].

New to this version, we incorporate this concept and use the term non-mass lesion. A non-mass lesion is a discrete finding that can be identified as distinctly different from normal tissue, is seen in 3 dimensions but lacks the discrete margination of a mass and cannot be assigned a specific shape. It is often subtle and may be detected only because the background tissue is disrupted. It may appear very different in different planes, and it may be visualized primarily in one plane only. Because it lacks a definitive shape or margin, coupled with the fact that it is often seen primarily in one plane only, size may be difficult to determine. It is important to note that a non-mass lesion is a distinct finding and that heterogeneous breast tissue alone does not constitute a non-mass lesion.

Similar to a mass, a non-mass lesion may have associated features that contribute to accurate detection and differentiate a real finding from normal heterogeneous breast tissue. An echogenic rind may accompany a non-mass lesion. Hypervascularity at Doppler imaging may also be seen. While neither secondary finding is specific for malignancy, their presence may help distinguish normal tissue (i.e., heterogeneous background tissue mimicking a non-mass lesion) from a non-mass lesion. Of the various sonographic features of a non-mass lesion, the single most predictive of malignancy is segmental distribution [31].</div>

Most of these findings in the mammography lexicon are included in "architectural distortion." Findings of breast edema and skin thickening may be present, caused by inflammatory breast cancer, radiation therapy, mastitis, or a systemic process such as congestive heart failure. Color and power Doppler vascular findings of an abnormality and tissue stiffness characteristics (elastography) are also associated features. Associated features help to characterize findings and may support the distinction between malignant and benign findings. However, for management decision, lesion morphology supersedes associated features; reassuring associated features do not obviate the need to biopsy a morphologically suspicious finding.</div>

These achieve higher temporal resolution while preserving high spatial resolution, allowing multiple early post-contrast acquisitions. If utilized, the faster frequent early sampling of the signal intensity time curve allows additional analysis in the first two minutes after contrast prior to early enhancement, while still supporting analysis of early and delayed enhancement. This early faster sampling can provide parameters including time-to-early

enhancement, slope of the contrast uptake curve, area under the signal time intensity curve, and identification of findings that enhance first in the breast (before BPE) as factors which may prove useful in lesion assessment.

Other techniques, such as proton MR spectroscopy, Na MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), hypoxia imaging and ultra-high field strength MRI (e.g., 7T) remain investigational at this time.</div>

The BI-RADS v2025 Manual includes new detailed guidance for counting, tracking and auditing all <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments (<u>Section III</u>, see page 846) for screening, asymptomatic diagnostic evaluations and diagnostic examinations performed to evaluate clinical problems. Indeed, patients, radiologists and facilities would benefit from knowing how frequently examinations initially assessed as probably benign continue to demonstrate benign findings. If too many (i.e., > 2%) of these cases are found subsequently to represent breast cancer, this would indicate incorrect assessment of truly suspicious findings as being probably benign. Such an outcome would be identified only through a separate "category 3 audit." This would permit appropriate action to be taken by the radiologist(s) involved to modify the interpretive criteria being used to assess findings as probably benign. This version of the Manual describes how to audit BI-RADS category 3 examinations.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Masses with an echogenic pseudocapsule have a thin white line surrounding an otherwise circumscribed margin. To be characterized as an echogenic pseudocapsule, the line must be uniformly thin and, importantly, must be visible around the entire margin of the mass. Oval or lobulated masses with a circumferential echogenic pseudocapsule and no suspicious features are very likely to be benign [29, 42–45], but other factors including interval growth must be considered. A round or irregular shaped mass typically should be biopsied regardless of the presence of an echogenic pseudocapsule.

An echogenic pseudocapsule must be distinguished from an echogenic rind, which is a wider, more ill-defined echogenic band that surrounds some or all of the margin of a mass or non-mass lesion and disrupts the tissue planes adjacent to the mass. An echogenic pseudocapsule is often associated with a benign mass; in contrast, an echogenic rind is usually suspicious, and the nature of the mass must be confirmed either by imaging (e.g., fat necrosis) or biopsy.

The mass has an associated ECHOGENIC PSEUDOCAPSULE that is uniformly thin and visible around all margins of the mass. Because this combination of features typically suggests a benign etiology, the mass was assessed as BI-RADS 3, probably benign, and 6-month imaging follow-up was recommended. The patient was then lost to follow-up but returned three years later, and the mass proved stable in size and appearance. Presumed diagnosis: Fibroadenoma.

Although a thin echogenic line surrounds part of the mass margin, the line is discontinuous in several locations and is completely missing along a portion of the mass in both radial and antiradial images (arrowheads). Because the echogenic line is incomplete, the mass does not have an echogenic pseudocapsule. Regardless, the shape is irregular, and the margin is angular. Therefore, an echogenic pseudocapsule – even if present – would be irrelevant, and the mass is suspicious. Pathology: Invasive ductal carcinoma.

We selected this term because it is immediately understandable and evocative of the imaging finding — a thick white band around a lesion. Rinds are thick. Rinds surround. An echogenic rind is typically found with either malignancy or fat necrosis, though other benign entities can occasionally demonstrate a rind. Because it is one of the most predictive features for malignancy at ultrasound, we proposed a term that will evoke an immediate suspicious connotation. An echogenic rind is thick and non-uniform, and it surrounds a lesion of any shape. In contrast, the echogenic pseudocapsule (a feature suggesting benignity) is thin and uniform, and it usually surrounds an oval mass.</div>

Breast trauma may present as a small or large painful, palpable mass or area of thickening that can be accompanied by breast swelling. Ultrasound may demonstrate findings consistent with a hematoma in the acute phase that will evolve over time, or fat necrosis which is seen later during post-trauma changes. Careful correlation with patient history is essential, although patients may not recall minor injuries and bruises to the breast that may still result in findings on physical breast exam or breast imaging.

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">Using lexicon terminology, the description of important findings should be made sequentially for each breast in order of clinical relevance. For example, all relevant findings for the left breast should be described followed by all relevant findings for the right breast. These findings' descriptions should include:

a. Characterization of a mass using echo pattern and the morphological descriptors of shape, margin, and orientation. Notes should be made of the lesion's effect on the surrounding tissue, such as architectural distortion and skin thickening. Other features, such as posterior features, as well as techniques, such as Doppler and elastography, should only be described for pertinent positives. For screening ultrasound examinations, characteristically benign findings may be reported (assessment category 2), but it is not obligatory, and the appropriate assessment would then be negative (assessment category 1).

- b. For important findings, size should be reported in three dimensions when possible. When measurement of three dimensions is not possible (e.g., non-mass lesions primarily visualized in one plane), as many measurable size dimensions as possible should be reported. When multiple incidental benign cysts (simple and/or complicated) are present, it is not necessary to report the measurements of every cyst.
- c. Locations of all important finding(s) should be reported using clock-face location and distance from the nipple. When more than one finding is located in the same scan frame or in the same locale, measurement of the distance from the skin to the center of each finding may help to differentiate one lesion from another. This distance from skin to finding may be particularly useful when one mass is singled out for biopsy, and others are depicted in the field. If the finding is close to the nipple, it is important to describe how far the anterior extent of the imaging finding is from the nipple base to assist with surgical planning. If the finding is large, distance to its anterior and posterior extents can also be included, to assist with surgical planning. If the findings are close to the skin, pectoralis muscle or chest wall, describe the distance of the findings to these structures. Due to differences in patient positioning and other technique factors, distance from the nipple, skin, pectoralis muscle and chest wall may vary across modalities.

It may be helpful to describe the anatomic zone where the finding lies to facilitate lesion identification when correlating among modalities. For example, noting that a mass lies at the subcutaneous fat-fibroglandular zone junction may allow for more efficient search and more confident identification when comparison to other modalities is undertaken.

- d. As with mammography, multiple bilateral circumscribed masses usually are assessed as benign due to their multiplicity and benign morphology (assessment category 2) [12]. In the unusual circumstance in which the interpreting physician chooses to describe multiple benign-appearing masses individually within the US report, the masses should be reported in list format by breast, by location within the breast, and by size. This type of report will be clearer, and, if surveillance is suggested as management, the performer of the subsequent examination will appreciate a concise list rather than lengthy loose text.
- e. If an US finding correlates with a finding on another imaging modality (e.g., mammography or MRI) or with a clinical finding (e.g., palpable lump), this correlation should be reported. Similarly, if an US finding is incidental and does not correlate with a finding described on another imaging modality or clinical exam, the incidental nature of this US finding should be reported. Such correlation statements will clarify potential confusion for report readers.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">Findings seen on CEM are divided into three broad categories: Those seen on the LE images only, those presenting as areas of enhancement only seen on the RC images, and those seen on the LE images with associated enhancement on the RC images. It should be clearly stated in the report whether a finding is seen on the LE images only, on the recombined images only, or on both. If there are separate findings on the LE and RC images, this should be clearly stated.

- C. Finding on LE images only: A finding apparent on the LE images only should be described using the BI-RADS mammography lexicon. For example, masses that demonstrate no enhancement may be described by their shape, margin, and density. Calcifications should be described as benign or if not classically benign, by their morphology and distribution.
- D. Findings on RC images only: A finding visualized only on the RC images may be described as a mass, non-mass enhancement, or an enhancing asymmetry. The descriptors for areas of enhancement on CEM are in general the same as those used for MRI. However, the CEM lexicon includes fewer descriptors than the MRI lexicon due to the lower resolution of CEM. In addition, unlike MRI, there are cases in which abnormal enhancement is seen on one view only. This should be called an "enhancing asymmetry." The conspicuity of the lesion, reflecting the degree of enhancement relative to background parenchymal enhancement may also be described.
  - Masses on RC images only: A mass is a 3D space-occupying lesion with a convex-outward contour. There may or may not be an identifiable correlate on the LE images. If there is no LE correlate, the mass shape/margin and internal pattern of enhancement should be characterized on the recombined images.
    - a. Shape: Descriptors for mass shape are the same as for MRI, and include oval, lobulated, round, or irregular shape. Lobulated has been added to the shape descriptors to match the updated mammography lexicon.
    - Margin: Descriptors for mass margin are the same as for MRI, and include circumscribed or non-circumscribed (indistinct, spiculated) margin. Note that the term indistinct is new to this version, replacing "irregular" to match the MRI lexicon change.
    - c. Internal pattern of enhancement: A mass may demonstrate homogeneous, heterogeneous, or rim enhancement. Note that while the MRI lexicon has been updated to describe suspicious peripheral mass enhancement as "thick rim enhancement" rather than "rim enhancement," the lexicon term is not being changed in CEM, as the lower resolution of CEM precludes differentiation between thick and thin rim enhancement.
  - Non-mass enhancement (NME) on RC images only: Enhancement that is neither a mass nor an enhancing asymmetry is classified as non-mass enhancement. NME should be classified according to its distribution and described as diffuse, regional, focal, linear, or segmental. "Multiple regions" has been removed as a descriptor to match the MRI lexicon

change, where it was found to be of limited value as a descriptor (diffuse may be more appropriate in many of those situations). Unlike with MRI, the internal enhancement pattern of NME may not be clearly discernible due to the lower resolution of CEM compared to MRI. If visible, internal enhancement pattern may be described as homogeneous, heterogeneous, or clumped.

- 3. Enhancing asymmetry: This term should be used for a finding seen on only one view on the RC images. If desired, the internal enhancement pattern of an asymmetry can be described as homogeneous or heterogeneous. If a one-view asymmetry is seen on the LE image and exhibits enhancement, it can also be described as an enhancing asymmetry.
- E. Findings seen on LE images with associated enhancement on recombined images: For enhancing lesions with a correlate on LE images (mass, asymmetry, focal asymmetry, architectural distortion, or calcifications); the LE finding should be described using the BI-RADS mammography lexicon. If the LE finding that enhances is not a mass (asymmetry, architectural distortion, or calcifications), the characteristics of the enhancement should be described using the CEM lexicon. For masses seen on the LE images that also enhance, it is not always necessary to further describe the mass shape and margin as seen on the RC images. Other descriptors besides shape and margin for enhancement seen on RC images include:
  - 1. Morphology-refer to mammography lexicon
  - 2. Internal pattern of enhancement: homogeneous, heterogeneous, rim
  - 3. Extent of enhancement
    - The mammographic lesion partially enhances
    - b. The mammographic lesion completely enhances
    - c. The enhancement extends beyond the mammographic lesion
    - d. There is no enhancement of the mammographic lesion but there is surrounding enhancement in the tissue adjacent to the lesion. This commonly occurs with inflamed cysts or fat necrosis.
- F. Lesion conspicuity: Lesion conspicuity (relative to background): Degree of enhancement relative to background may be described as low, moderate, or high. These are subjective qualitative descriptors relative to the degree of background parenchymal enhancement. Low refers to enhancement equal to or slightly greater than BPE, high if the enhancement is much greater than BPE, and moderate if the enhancement is in between low and high. For CEM, there is no data yet to correlate lesion conspicuity with likelihood of malignancy. Terms for conspicuity are included in the lexicon to allow for future research.
  - 1. Low
  - 2. Moderate
  - 3. High
- **G.** Associated Features: These are generally seen on the LE images and can also sometimes be appreciated on the RC images.
  - 1. Nipple retraction: Nipple retraction is when the nipple is pulled in. New nipple retraction is associated with increased suspicion of underlying pathology.
  - 2. Nipple involvement: Tumor is contiguous and invades the nipple.
  - 3. Skin retraction: Skin is pulled in abnormally.

- 4. Skin thickening: Skin thickening is defined as being > 2 mm in thickness. Skin thickening without enhancement may represent post-treatment related changes (such as surgery and/or radiation) or a systemic process if bilateral and diffuse. However, diffuse skin thickening, with or without areas of enhancement, may also be secondary to lymphatic obstruction from malignancy or locally advanced breast cancer.
- 5. Skin involvement: Skin involvement may be seen with direct tumor invasion or with inflammatory cancer and is confirmed by enhancement (as opposed to isolated thickening).
- Axillary adenopathy: Enlarged axillary lymph nodes may warrant comment, clinical correlation and additional evaluation, especially if they are new or considerably larger or
  rounder when compared to prior studies. Refer to Mammography section IV.E. for more
  in-depth discussion on lymph node morphology.
- H. Location of finding: The location of a suspicious finding should be described using standard clock-face (preferred) and/or quadrant descriptor. Similar to mammography, the side is given first, followed by the clock-face and/or quadrant location, and the depth of the lesion (anterior, middle, or posterior third and/or distance from nipple in cm). See additional detail about reporting finding location below in Report Organization section in IV.B.5.b.

Note: Gray-filled boxes indicate data used in audit calculations for screening. Numbers and outcomes above serve as an example based on performance benchmarks published in this Manual.

<u>Basic Clinically Relevant Audit Example for Screening</u>: Cancer ascertainment period for this example is 1 year, the standard screening interval recommended by the ACR (Figure 2).

 True-positives: Breast cancer diagnoses within one year of a positive screening examination (category 0, 3, 4, and 5).

A caveat to this is examinations for which there is no difference in the images recorded for a screening or diagnostic examination.

- 3. Positive predictive values:
  - PPV<sub>1</sub> = Percentage of all positive screening examinations (category 0, 3, 4, and 5) that result in a tissue diagnosis of cancer within 1 standard interval (1 year in the U.S.)

$$= \frac{TP}{Positive \ screening \ examinations} \ OR \ \frac{TP}{TP + FP_1} = \frac{950}{20,000}$$

7. Percentage of stage 0 or I cancers:

$$= \frac{Stage\ 0\ cancers + stage\ I\ cancers}{TP} \times 100$$

$$= \frac{DCIS + fLCIS + pLCIS + stage\ I\ cancers}{TP} \times 100$$

<u>Basic Clinically Relevant Audit Example for Diagnostic Imaging</u>: Cancer ascertainment period for this example is 1 year, the standard screening interval recommended by the ACR (Figure 3).

Note: For diagnostic examinations performed as recall imaging (following BI-RADS category 0 assessment at screening), the interval to cancer diagnosis begins on the date of the screening examination. For diagnostic examinations performed for other indications, such as a new palpable lump, the interval to cancer diagnosis begins on the date of the diagnostic examination.

                <div class="document-content">A focal asymmetry is an area of tissue that is confined to less than one quadrant and asymmetric to the corresponding location in the contralateral breast. It is visible and may appear similar on multiple mammographic projections (hence, a real finding rather than superimposition of normal breast structures) but lacks the convex contour, central density and the conspicuity of a mass. The contour of a focal asymmetry is concave and there is usually interspersed fat.

Note that occasionally what is properly described as a focal asymmetry at screening (i.e., a finding visible on standard MLO and CC views) is determined at diagnostic mammography to be two different findings, (i.e., two separate asymmetries, each representing superimposed normal tissue) or, alternatively, an actual mass. A focal asymmetry that is new or increasing in size or conspicuity compared to prior mammograms is more suspicious than a focal asymmetry seen on a baseline mammogram and these two entities should be managed differently (i.e., biopsy of a new or increasing focal asymmetry; short-term follow-up of a focal asymmetry seen on baseline exam assuming no additional mammographic or sonographic findings are present at diagnostic evaluation).

Although the term "developing asymmetry" as a descriptor has been discontinued in this version, the clinical importance of a new or increasingly conspicuous focal asymmetry should be strongly stressed. If confirmed to be a real finding on diagnostic evaluation, biopsy should be recommended even in the absence of an ultrasound correlate, as the positive predictive value for such a finding is in the range of 7.4–12.8% when detected on screening and 19.7–26.7% in the diagnostic setting [31, 32].

**Figure 1** – FOCAL ASYMMETRY (DM). The asymmetric dense tissue occupies less than the entire upper inner quadrant of the right breast. Presumed benign. Long-term stability was observed by comparison with previous examinations.

![](images/_page_34_Picture_1.jpeg)

Figure 2 – FOCAL ASYMMETRY (DM). This finding was seen on CC and MLO screening views and appeared similar on both views (only one detailed view shown here). The tissue has a concave contour, is interspersed with fat, and has no associated mass, architectural distortion, or abnormal calcifications. There was no correlate at targeted US examination. This finding was assessed as probably benign after full diagnostic imaging work-up, but slight interval enlargement at 6-month follow-up examination then prompted a suspicious assessment. Pathology (stereotactic core biopsy): Invasive ductal carcinoma.

# E. LYMPH NODES

INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODES (IMLN)

Normal intramammary lymph nodes are circumscribed masses that are reniform in shape and have hilar fat. Rigorous, peer-reviewed data providing clear morphologic standards to differentiate benign and suspicious intramammary lymph nodes on mammography are currently absent. Morphology is the most important factor to consider in the assessment of lymph nodes.

- a. Normal intramammary lymph nodes typically display reniform shape and a fatty hilum. Intramammary lymph nodes most commonly occur in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, approaching the axilla, although they may occur elsewhere in the breast. New oval circumscribed masses should not be assumed to be lymph nodes unless they fulfill morphologic criteria, especially when they are not located laterally. They often are seen adjacent to an artery or vein because the lymphatic drainage of the breast often parallels the vascular drainage. The presence of hilar fat and the relationship to an adjacent vessel is often more apparent on DBT than DM.
- b. <u>Abnormal lymph nodes</u> may show rounded morphology and or loss of fatty hila and/or subjectively thickened cortices. Changes in lymph node size or shape from prior imaging or asymmetry compared to contralateral intramammary nodes, may raise suspicion in the appropriate clinical context [33, 34].

The lymph node in lateral left breast in a patient with prior breast conserving therapy was larger than on prior exams and has lost its reniform shape. Because of these changes, it underwent US-guided core biopsy. A tissue maker lies in the lymph node. Pathology: Recurrent invasive ductal carcinoma in an intramammary lymph node.

Because foreign bodies have a variety of appearances on ultrasound, clinical history and mammographic correlation are often crucial in establishing the presence and nature of foreign matter within the patient. Most foreign bodies are echogenic with a variable appearance depending on their shape and size. Small and thin foreign bodies, such as retained wires, may not be detectable on ultrasound, as echogenic structures may blend into the surrounding echogenic fibroglandular tissue and Cooper's ligaments.

                <div class="document-content">Lymph nodes are normal findings in the breast and in the axilla. Morphologically, they are oval or reniform in shape and circumscribed in margin. Lymph nodes consist of two parts: 1) hypoechoic cortex; 2) echogenic hilum containing fat. The presence of Doppler signal flow into and out of the hilum representing the afferent and efferent blood vessels is helpful in recognizing lymph nodes.

Following is an outline of the parameters that may be used to characterize a lymph node at US [1, 69, 70].

- a. Size
- b. Shape
  - i. Oval or reniform
  - ii. Lobulated
    - Round
    - Irregular
- c. Cortical thickening (> 3 mm)
  - i. Diffuse, concentric, uniform: be wary of technical parameters such as oblique angle of insonation that may falsely increase apparent cortical thickening, both concentric and focal. Real-time scanning should help identify true cortical thickening.
  - ii. Focal, eccentric: hypoechoic cortical bulge may be seen in nodal metastases, representing tumor cells trapped in the follicles in the cortex of the lymph node.
- d. Margin
  - Circumscribed
  - Non-circumscribed: indistinctness of margin may be a sign of extranodal extension of tumor
- e. Hilum
  - i. Hilar compression or displacement

Note that the presence of fat in a nodal hilus does not exclude metastatic involvement; the hilar fat may be compressed or displaced by the metastasis or other pathology. A pathological node may present with diminished or eccentrically located hilar fat.

ii. Hilar effacement or replacement

Tumor involvement of the lymph node can result in a spectrum of morphological changes [1, 69, 70]. On the benign-appearing end of the spectrum, a node may show either echogenic fatty hilum only or mostly fatty hilum surrounded by a thin (≤3 mm) nearly imperceptible hypoechoic cortex. When a node becomes reactive or subtly involved by tumor, the hypoechoic cortex may become diffusely thickened (>3 mm) and/or assume a generalized lobulated thickened appearance, as shown in the setting of vaccine-induced reactive adenopathy [71] and nodal metastases of lobular histology [72]. On the malignant-appearing end of the spectrum, the cortical lobulation may be focal, the hilum may be compressed or displaced, or there may be complete absence of the fatty hilum when the entire node is replaced by tumor cells +/− lymphocytes. When there is complete absence of a fatty hilum, there is a high probability of the lymph node being malignant. Nodal hypoechogenicity (representing tumor cells +/− abnormal lymphocytes) has extended beyond or expanded the

cortex because of the ongoing pathological process. The shape is usually round or irregular at this stage, but it would be considered abnormal even if it remains oval.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Contrast enhanced mammography is referred to by several different names including contrast enhanced digital mammography and contrast enhanced spectral mammography. The preferred term which avoids overlap with proprietary names is contrast enhanced mammography (CEM).

The post-processed combination of low and high energy images should be referred to as the recombined images (RC images).

When starting to utilize this technique, it is prudent to decide for which indications and clinical settings the study will be used. There is evidence that CEM may be useful for a variety of indications including determination of extent of disease in newly diagnosed breast cancer, response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, problem solving, and intermediate and high-risk screening. It should be noted that as of the release of the BI-RADS v2025 Manual, the use of CEM for screening is not yet FDA approved, therefore the use of this modality for screening purposes is considered an off-label indication. CEM has also been proposed as an alternative to MRI when the patient is not a candidate for MRI. For any proposed indication, it is worthwhile to have a predetermined workflow for evaluation of (RC) imaging findings that have no correlate on conventional mammography or ultrasound. Although CEM-guided biopsy devices are FDA approved, these findings are commonly pursued with MRI and MRI-guided biopsy as there is currently limited availability of CEM-guided biopsy although it is in gaining clinical penetrance. If MRI or MRI-guided biopsy is not available or cannot be tolerated by the patient, an alternative approach for these findings will be needed and this should be recognized before CEM is performed. If neither CEM-guided nor MRI-guided biopsy are available, possible options, depending on the level of suspicion of the finding, could include short interval follow-up CEM, stereotactic biopsy using landmarks, or in rare circumstances image guided localization using landmarks followed by surgical excision.

CEM requires the use of IV iodinated contrast and patients should be evaluated for risks for contrast reaction. In addition, personnel at facilities that offer CEM should be fully trained and equipped to deal with contrast reactions. For patients who report prior contrast reactions, pre-medication can be considered to reduce the possibility of subsequent reaction. However, the data on reducing severe reactions has not been consistently demonstrated. Overall, the potential benefit of performing CEM in these patients should be weighed against the possibility of a serious contrast reaction or side effects of the pre-medication.

Many facilities choose to screen patients for impaired renal function or other relative contraindications to IV contrast. If this is elected by a facility, criteria for who should be screened prior to the CEM examination should be the same as those used prior to CT studies that require contrast. Also, any screening to determine suitability for contrast administration should happen at the time of scheduling so that lab work assessing renal function, if required, can be obtained before the patient's CEM visit. For patients with compromised renal function, the benefit of CEM should be weighed against the risk of contrast induced nephropathy prior to scheduling the exam. For a full discussion of the use of IV contrast please refer to the ACR Manual on Contrast Media available on the ACR website (https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Clinical-Tools-and-Reference/Contrast-Manual).</div>

                <div class="document-content">A global asymmetry is tissue that extends over a substantial portion of the breast (at least one quadrant) and is asymmetric to the corresponding area in the contralateral breast. There is no associated mass, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications. Global asymmetries usually represent a normal but asymmetric distribution of fibroglandular breast tissue, often first described on a baseline mammogram. When enlarging or associated with a clinical finding, global asymmetries cannot be dismissed as benign, as some malignancies may present as large areas of asymmetric tissue.

                <div class="document-content">Gynecomastia is the benign development of breast tissue either unilaterally or bilaterally in the cisgender male patient. There are numerous potential causes of gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is commonly the result of alterations in hormone levels due to physiologic status in adolescents or older patients. Anti-depressants, prostate cancer medications, steroids, antibiotics, chemotherapy, or certain types of cardiovascular medicines may contribute to gynecomastia, as can marijuana, methamphetamines, alcohol, and heroin. Alternatively, systemic disease processes such as liver failure, kidney disease, lung cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disorders and tumors of the adrenal and pituitary glands can also stimulate the development of breast tissue [41]. Patients may present with a tender palpable abnormality in the subareolar region of one or both breasts. In men with clinical findings consistent with gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia (i.e., breast enlargement in men primarily due to fatty tissue but with no associated glandular or stromal tissue) no imaging is routinely recommended. Hormone-induced breast tissue occurring in transfeminine patients should not be characterized as gynecomastia.

On mammography, breast density should be documented in male patients similar to female patients. Breast density is assigned based on the densest portion of the breast tissue, indicating the potential of obscuring a malignancy, using accepted BI-RADS terminology. There are no well-established or validated descriptors of the extent of gynecomastia. Radiologists may report a qualitative assessment of the pattern of gynecomastia (e.g., nodular, dendritic, diffuse; see examples in Figure 1) although data on patient outcomes are currently lacking. Other findings such as calcifications, masses, asymmetries or distortions should be described if present as these entities are not typically associated with gynecomastia and will likely require further evaluation.

The laterality of the finding as left or right should always be reported. The position of the finding within the breast should be described by clock face or if large, by quadrant. Depth or distance from the nipple to the center of the finding should be reported. If the finding is large, distance to its anterior and posterior extents can be included. Also, it may be helpful to describe the anatomic zone where the finding lies to facilitate lesion identification when correlating among modalities. For example, noting that a mass lies at the subcutaneous fat-fibroglandular zone junction may allow easier search and more confident identification when mammographic or MRI correlation is performed.

Finding location should be described by laterality first, followed by clock face and/or quadrant, and then depth or distance from the nipple. The following are examples of a finding location description.</div>

                <div class="document-content">This is a glossary for the basic and comprehensive audit of a breast imaging practice, both of which are described in detail following the glossary:

- 1. Screening examination any examination performed for people without any reported symptoms, clinical signs or imaging findings of breast cancer. Screening involves the binary decision of recommending action before the next interval screening versus recommending no action until the next interval screening. Specific to auditing and outcome monitoring, an examination should be considered a screening examination if it is performed on an asymptomatic person with any additional indication for screening listed below in Table 1.
- 2. Diagnostic examination any examination applied to patients to further characterize or reassess any imaging findings or clinical signs or symptoms, that may or may not be malignant. Diagnostic examinations can be performed on the same day as the screening examination and within the same visit if desired; however, separate screening and diagnostic reports are recommended, and separate tracking for the audit is required. The recommendation for, or acquisition of, additional images beyond those prescribed by the standard screening protocol, to further evaluate a finding before conclusion of the standard interval, constitutes action and provides an objective and reproducible rule that defines the "positive" screening examination. This accomplishes objectivity and reproducibility by basing the auditing rule on something that does not rely on subjective review. Specific to auditing and outcome monitoring, an examination should be considered a diagnostic examination if it is performed for any of the indications for diagnostic imaging listed below in Table 1.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>a</sup> Only the most common potential indications for screening are listed here. A "screening examination" is best defined as one performed on asymptomatic people to detect early, clinically unsuspected breast cancer. Screening involves the binary decision of recommending action before the next screening versus recommending no action until the next screening.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>b</sup> At the interpreter's discretion, after completing the institutional period of follow-up earlier than the standard interval after breast conservation therapy, the patient may return to screening. That patient would thereafter undergo imaging in the *screening examinations* group under the indication of "personal history of breast cancer."

- 3. Tissue diagnosis — This is a pathologic diagnosis rendered after any type of interventional procedure (fine-needle aspiration cytology, core biopsy, incisional biopsy, excisional biopsy). A tissue diagnosis is considered concordant if the cytological or histological diagnosis rendered by the pathologist fully accounts for the imaging findings of the biopsied abnormality. A tissue diagnosis is discordant if the cytological or histological diagnosis rendered by the pathologist does not account for the imaging findings of the biopsied abnormality. Examples of discordant tissue diagnoses include histological diagnosis of fibroadenoma for a spiculated mass containing fine linear calcifications, and histological diagnosis of benign fibrofatty breast tissue for a circumscribed oval solid mass. Also included in the definition of tissue diagnosis is diagnostic cyst aspiration, performed to confirm the suspected diagnosis of cyst for cases in which mammographic and sonographic findings are not characteristically benign, with aspiration of cyst fluid accompanied by disappearance of the suspected cyst making it unnecessary to obtain a pathologic diagnosis. Note that therapeutic cyst aspiration is not included in the definition of tissue diagnosis. Such an aspiration, performed for characteristically benign cysts to provide symptomatic relief of focal pain or tenderness or to relieve patient anxiety, is not defined as tissue diagnosis because the interventional procedure is not recommended for diagnostic purposes.
- 4. Positive screening examination This is a screening examination for which additional diagnostic imaging is recommended prior to the next interval screening examination to further evaluate a screening-detected finding whether or not the patient remains in the breast imaging facility (whether or not separate screening and diagnostic reports are issued); or for which tissue diagnosis is recommended. The unique aspects of screening mammography, breast US, and breast MRI examinations are considered in the following paragraphs that describe positive screening examinations but the positive assessments (BI-RADS category 0, 3, 4 and 5) remain consistent throughout.
  - a. Mammography A positive screening examination is most often related to a recall (BI-RADS category 0) for diagnostic breast imaging performed on a future date. However, a screening examination is also positive when additional diagnostic breast imaging is performed to further evaluate a screen-detected finding while the patient remains in the breast imaging facility (real time interpretation). The screening examination should still be counted positive (BI-RADS category 0) when the results of the screening and diagnostic examinations are combined into a single report on the same day, regardless of the final diagnostic BI-RADS category assessment. Recommending tissue diagnosis or short-term follow-up (BI-RADS categories 4 and 5 or BI-RADS category 3, respectively) directly from screening is specifically discouraged. Such screening examinations are considered positive for the purposes of the audit and count towards the recall rate while denying the patient and radiologist an opportunity for work-up and discussion of the significance of the findings. Note that this definition of a positive screening examination is different from that used in the MQSA Final Rule [1], for which "positive" examinations are limited to those for which tissue diagnosis is recommended.

Also note that BI-RADS category 3 assessments should not be used for screening mammography examinations; rather, category 3 assessments should be used only after appropriate imaging work-up of screening-detected findings. Note that a screening examination assessed as BI-RADS category 3 with the recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging is classified as a positive screening examination, and included in the recall rate calculation because additional imaging is recommended before the next interval screening.

b. Breast US — The ACR Practice Parameters describe the standard protocol for screening examinations. As with screening mammography, a screening breast US examination is negative when the radiologist assigns a BI-RADS category 1 or 2 assessment. The BI-RADS 2 assessment includes findings that are classically benign, such as coarse calcifications on

mammogram and simple cysts on US, that do not require any additional diagnostic imaging. As with screening mammography, a screening breast US is positive when the examination is interpreted after the patient leaves the facility, and the final assessment is 0, 3, 4 or 5. A screening breast US is also positive when the interpreting radiologist performs, or directs a sonographer to perform, additional diagnostic breast US to further evaluate a potentially abnormal finding detected with screening US.

The ACR Practice Parameter and this Manual strongly recommend that sonographers or interpreting radiologists document diagnostic evaluations by acquiring and permanently archiving representative images. From an auditing perspective, this is identical to the acquisition of diagnostic mammography views, beyond the standard screening examination, to evaluate a mammographic finding while the patient remains at the facility for immediate results. This definition of a positive screening US examination is consistent with a modality neutral approach and applies to all examinations performed with a handheld transducer, whether the operator is the interpreting physician or an appropriately trained sonographer. As with online interpretation of a positive screening mammography examination, the acquisition of additional (diagnostic) images beyond those prescribed by the standard screening protocol, to further evaluate a finding at the direction of the interpreting radiologist, creates a diagnostic examination and converts the screening US examination to positive for auditing purposes, whether separate screening and diagnostic reports are issued.

The definition of a positive screening US examination is identical for automated screening breast US and handheld screening breast US if patients remain for results or depart the facility. When patients leave the facility and are recalled for additional diagnostic breast imaging examination(s) to further evaluate a potentially abnormal finding, this is, from an auditing perspective, identical to batch interpretation of a screening mammography examination for which the patient is recalled for additional diagnostic breast imaging (BI-RADS 0). Any type of screening US examination assessed as BI-RADS category 3, 4 or 5, is also a positive screening examination because additional action is recommended before the next screening.

- c. Breast MRI As with all other modalities, category 0, 3, 4 and 5 assessments on screening MRI are positive because additional action is recommended before the next screening. Unlike screening mammography and ultrasound, category 0 assessments for MRI should be rare, see page 703, and category 4 and 5 assessments are much more common for findings on screening breast MRI examinations. Historically, screening and diagnostic MRI protocols have been identical or nearly identical, allowing sufficient confidence for interpretation, assessment and recommendations for screen-detected findings without a separate additional diagnostic step. This remains within the acceptable standard of care. It is important for ongoing protocol development to separately audit breast MRI examinations performed for screening and/or diagnostic indications with full and/or abbreviated protocols to establish useful comparative benchmarks.
- 5. Positive diagnostic examination (all modalities) This is a diagnostic examination for which tissue diagnosis is recommended (BI-RADS categories 4 and 5).
- 6. Negative diagnostic examination (all modalities) This is a diagnostic examination for which tissue diagnosis is not recommended, that is, an examination assessed as negative, benign, or probably benign (BI-RADS category 1, 2, or 3 respectively). Note that a category 3 assessment is considered negative at diagnostic breast imaging (because tissue diagnosis is not recommended), whereas a category 3 assessment is considered positive at screening breast imaging (because it is associated with the recommendation for additional imaging before the next routine screening examination).

<sup>\*</sup>A positive screening examination is defined as one for which additional diagnostic imaging or tissue diagnosis is recommended prior to the next screening examination. Note that the use of BI-RADS categories 3, 4, and 5 at screening mammography are discouraged.

- Cancer This is tissue diagnosis of either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), pleomorphic or florid lobular carcinoma in situ, or any type of primary (not metastatic) invasive breast carcinoma (Table 3).
- Standard Ascertainment Interval For auditing purposes, positive and negative truth are
  defined relative to the presence or absence of a tissue diagnosis of cancer within a standard
  ascertainment interval of time after breast imaging examination.
  - a. Screening Ascertainment Interval In the definitions listed later in this section (true-positive, true-negative, etc.), as well as in the subsequent examples, the standard screening ascertainment interval is 1 year (365 days). Breast imaging facilities with an alternate accepted local standard interval, such as 2 years, whether in the United States or elsewhere, should consistently replace the 1-year interval with their standard interval.
  - b. Diagnostic Ascertainment Interval
    - For diagnostic examinations performed as recall imaging (following BI-RADS category 0
      assessment at screening), the ascertainment interval to cancer diagnosis begins on the
      date of the screening examination.
    - ii. For diagnostic examinations performed for other indications not prompted by a recall from screening, such as a clinically detected lump, the ascertainment interval to cancer diagnosis begins on the date of the diagnostic examination. The standard diagnostic interval is 1 year (365 days).
  - c. Probably Benign Ascertainment Interval For <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessments, the standard ascertainment interval is defined as the period routinely used by the breast imaging facility for total imaging surveillance of BI-RADS category 3 findings. In the U.S. the most common surveillance interval is 2 years, therefore, a positive outcome is a breast cancer diagnosis within 2 years of the <u>initial</u> BI-RADS category 3 assessment.
- True-Positive (TP) There is tissue diagnosis of breast cancer within one standard ascertainment interval after a positive examination (BI-RADS categories 0, 3, 4, or 5 for screening; BI-RADS categories 4 or 5 for diagnostic). BI-RADS category 3 assessments made at screening are positive examinations.
- True-Negative (TN) There is no known tissue diagnosis of breast cancer within one standard ascertainment interval of a negative examination (BI-RADS categories 1 or 2 for screening; BI-RADS categories 1, 2, or 3 for diagnostic).
- False-Negative (FN) There is tissue diagnosis of breast cancer within one standard ascertainment interval of a negative examination (BI-RADS category 1 or 2 for screening, BI-RADS category 1, 2, or 3 for diagnostic).

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>b</sup> A positive diagnostic examination is one for which tissue diagnosis is recommended. Note that an incomplete (BI-RADS category 0) assessment should be made only rarely at diagnostic imaging due to inherent radiologist oversight of the examination, and category 0 assessments at diagnostic imaging are therefore not included in the audit.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>a</sup>The concordant result of mammary (breast) malignancy is considered a positive pathology result. Imaging assessed as positive within the standard ascertainment interval of 1 year (365 days) prior to these diagnoses should be recorded as a true-positive. Imaging examinations that include findings of biopsy-proven pathology from the "True-Positive" column are appropriately assessed as BI-RADS assessment category 6, known malignancy.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>b</sup> The concordant result of benign or non-mammary (non-breast) malignancy is considered a negative pathology result. Imaging assessed as positive within the standard ascertainment interval of 1 year (365 days) prior to these diagnoses should be recorded as a false-positive. Imaging examinations that include findings of biopsy-proven histology from the "False-Positive" columns are appropriately assessed as BI-RADS assessment category 2, benign.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>c</sup>There are additional benign pathologies in the complete Data Dictionary maintained by the National Mammography Database (NMD) https://nrdrsupport.acr.org/support/solutions/articles/11000041537-nmd-data-dictionary

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>d</sup> Breast cancer in the axilla, diagnosed as a metastasis to an axillary lymph node is a false-positive. Breast cancer diagnosed as a primary cancer in the axilla, not involving a lymph node, is a true-positive.

- 12. False-Positive (FP) There are three separate definitions:
  - a. FP<sub>1</sub>: No known tissue diagnosis of breast cancer within one standard ascertainment interval
    of a positive screening examination. This includes BI-RADS category 3 assessments made
    at screening.
  - b. FP<sub>2</sub>: No known tissue diagnosis of breast cancer within one standard ascertainment interval after recommendation for tissue diagnosis or surgical consultation (BI-RADS category 4 or 5).
  - c. FP<sub>3</sub>: Concordant benign tissue diagnosis (or discordant benign tissue diagnosis and no known tissue diagnosis of breast cancer) within one standard ascertainment interval after recommendation for tissue diagnosis (BI-RADS category 4 or 5).

Note: TP + TN + FP + FN = Total number of examinations. This note refers to terms 9, 10, 11, and 12.

- 13. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) There are three separate definitions:
  - a. PPV<sub>1</sub> (abnormal findings at screening): The percentage of all positive screening examinations that result in a tissue diagnosis of breast cancer within one standard ascertainment interval. PPV<sub>1</sub> can be significantly different for each modality and accepted practice patterns. For example, nearly all positive screening mammography assessments constitute BI-RADS category 0. Screening assessments of BI-RADS categories 3, 4 or 5 are rare (use discouraged) for mammography but are possible. Positive breast MRI screening examinations, however, frequently receive a BI-RADS category 4 or 5 assessment and categories 0 and 3 are much less common.

 $PPV_1 = TP/(number of positive screening examinations)$</div>

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>1</sup>In July 2025, the FDA approved an alternative standard that would allow the interpreting physician to provide an overall assessment of breast density that is phrased in the singular phrasing. The singular phrasing is intended to be used in reports of unilateral mammograms. Please see Mammography Guidance section item #10 for more information.

A. Breast density: Breast composition should be assessed on the LE images and characterized using categories similar to conventional mammography. The report should include a description of the breast composition using one of the following terms:

**Breast Density Categories** 

- (A) The breasts are almost entirely fatty
- (B) There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density
- (C) The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses
- (D) The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography

- B. Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE): The presence of background parenchymal enhancement of the normal breast tissue should be described. As CEM is performed with IV contrast, fibroglandular breast parenchyma may demonstrate normal enhancement. BPE is not necessarily directly related to the amount of fibroglandular tissue and should be described as:
  - 1. Level
    - a. Minimal
    - b. Mild
    - c. Moderate
    - d. Marked

As is the case with MRI, BPE should be described relative to the amount of the fibroglandular tissue and not the entire volume of the breast.

- 2. Symmetric vs Asymmetric:
  - Symmetric BPE denotes similar levels and distribution of BPE between the two breasts.
  - b. Asymmetric BPE denotes a greater level of broad distribution of enhancement in one breast than in the other. This may be seen after radiation therapy, with the radiated breast showing less BPE. If asymmetric BPE is seen without a known cause, it should be evaluated as it may represent a pathologic process such as diffuse inflammation or diffuse malignancy in the breast with the asymmetrically higher BPE.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">Breast density is defined as the relative proportion of breast parenchyma to fat within the breast. Mammographically, breast parenchyma is radiodense relative to radiolucent fat. There are four categories of breast density (Table 2): the breasts are almost entirely fatty, there are scattered areas of fibroglandular density, the breasts are heterogeneously dense which may obscure small masses, and the breasts are extremely dense which limits the sensitivity of mammography. Reporting breast density is required by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) legislation as of September 2024. Language included in the report both to the referring physician and the patient must follow the federal guidance.

People with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts are considered to have dense breasts, while those with almost entirely fatty breasts or scattered areas of fibroglandular density are considered to be non-dense. Most commonly, the interpreting radiologist subjectively categorizes the breast density using visual inspection of the breast parenchyma on the craniocaudal and mediolateral DM or SM views, although FDA-approved automated density measurement software is available. With the BI-RADS 5th Edition, the classification of breast density changed from an evaluation of the percentage of dense tissue to an assessment based on the likelihood that overlying tissue may obscure a cancer. This classification continues in v2025. If tissue in one region is dense and potentially masking an underlying cancer, then the breast density classification should be based on an assessment of this region, rather than the overall amount of parenchymal tissue. If each breast falls into a different density category, the greater density of the two is assigned to that examination. Breast density can be variable from year to year, depending on multiple factors such as weight gain or loss, estrogen replacement therapy, menopause, etc. Therefore, breast density is updated at each examination to accurately reflect the current breast density.

Breast density is significant for two reasons: mammographic accuracy and breast cancer risk. The impact of breast density on mammographic accuracy is due to the masking effect of dense fibroglandular tissue. With film-screen mammography, sensitivity declines significantly from fatty breasts to extremely dense breasts [9]. The masking effect caused by dense breast tissue has been reduced by advances in technology, first with the adoption of digital mammography, and, more recently, with DBT. In the DMIST trial, the sensitivity of mammography in women with dense breasts increased from 55% with film mammography to 70% with digital mammography [10]. With DBT, the interpreting radiologist can scroll through images of the breast slice by slice, further reducing the masking effect of dense breast tissue. In women with dense breasts, the cancer detection rate increased from 4.5 per 1000 women screened with DBT (p<0.001) [11].

As with increasing age, pathogenic genetic variants, family history, and reproductive factors, having dense breasts confers an increased inherent risk for developing breast cancer. Compared to the breasts of women with scattered fibroglandular tissue, the odds ratio of breast cancer is 0.6 for almost entirely fatty, 1.4 for heterogeneously dense, and 1.6 for extremely dense breasts [12].</div>

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">As for mammography and ultrasound, the goal of breast MRI interpretation is to answer the primary clinical question raised by the indication or reason for the examination. The clinical indication for the breast MRI should be understood and reported when interpreting the examination.

New to this version of BI-RADS are structured categories for the major clinical indications for breast imaging, with associated optional subcategories and relevant clinical histories. These structured categories should be used for breast MRI reporting and also for mammography, CEM, and ultrasound reporting. Use of these structured indications has many benefits, including to facilitate auditing of outcomes according to the different major indication categories of screening versus non-screening examinations, which have different diagnostic performance outcomes.

The breast MRI report history or indication section should specify the <u>major clinical indication</u> in one of the three new categorical indications of 1) Asymptomatic Screening, 2) Diagnostic: Work-Up, or 3) Diagnostic: Current Breast Cancer. The indication of Asymptomatic Screening should only be used in patients who are asymptomatic with no current clinical or imaging findings or current breast cancer.

When possible, the breast MRI report history or indication section should also include the <u>optional subcategory indication</u>, such as for Asymptomatic Screening the subcategory Gene Mutation, or for Diagnostic: Current Breast Cancer the subcategory Extent of Disease Before Definitive Surgery.

In addition, the <u>relevant clinical history</u> that could significantly influence MRI interpretation should be reported. Depending upon the indication, relevant history may include estimated breast cancer risk and/or specific risk factors, the current clinical or imaging findings. For the indication of Diagnostic: Current Breast Cancer, it is very important to understand the location and size of the current cancer on prior imaging, and it is helpful to include this history or indication section of the MRI report. Hormone-related or -influencing scenarios such as a recent pregnancy, lactation, menstrual cycle phase, and/or use of hormone replacement or antiestrogen therapy should in general be reported when they are important in explaining the MRI findings on a particular examination, such as "rebound" background parenchymal enhancement after cessation of antiestrogen therapy.

It has completely or partially convex margin and, when radiodense, appears denser in the center than at the periphery. Historically, a mass, by definition, had to be visualized on two mammographic projections. However, all the requirements used to define a mass may be apparent on a single projection when imaged on DBT. Visualization of a mass on only one view may occur if there is obscuring fibroglandular tissue or the mass is out of the field of view on the other projection. In such cases, it may be appropriate to use the mass descriptor despite visibility on only a single view.</div>

                <div class="document-content">The reporting system is designed to provide an organized approach to image interpretation and reporting. Not only is the use of approved terminology critical to produce an understandable breast imaging report, but the order in which the information is conveyed is also important. In addition to the usual organization of the breast imaging report, the LE and the RC images should be described separately, and the final assessment should be based on the most suspicious findings on each of these components. Standardized reporting facilitates clear and concise communication across disciplines and permits simultaneous data collection for future outcomes review (i.e., medical audit, tumor registry). Although not required, a structured reporting system will allow individual interpreting physicians and mammography facilities to monitor their own results and appraise the accuracy of image interpretation so that they can adjust interpretive thresholds appropriately. Note that use of ACR-approved computer-based reporting software is required for participation in the ACR National Mammography Database (NMD) (https://nrdr.acr.org/Portal/NMD/Main/page.aspx).</div>

                <div class="document-content">Recent amendments to MQSA regulations, which took effect on Sept. 10, 2024, resulted in the creation of two new assessment categories for mammography under category 0 (replacing the previous combined descriptive verbiage of "Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation and/or Prior imaging comparison"). The two new MQSA-required categories are: Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation, used to indicate that the examination is incompletely evaluated, and the recommendation is for additional imaging evaluation (e.g., supplementary mammographic views and/or US); and Category 0: Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison, to be used if retrieval of previous examinations for comparison is indicated before a final assessment can be rendered. For consistency, this updated verbiage has been generalized across the Manual for the other modalities. However, since prior studies desired for comparison may not be limited to mammograms, the terminology in the sections other than the Mammography chapter has been modified to say Category 0: Incomplete: Need prior imaging for comparison.

Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation, this assessment is almost always used in a screening situation to recall a patient for diagnostic evaluation. A screening breast US is assigned Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation when the examination is interpreted after the patient leaves the facility and additional imaging is needed to assess an abnormal finding. It is also used when the patient remains at the facility for immediate results and additional diagnostic breast US is performed to further evaluate a potentially abnormal finding detected with screening US. In this situation, the final report may communicate a single overall assessment (that reflects the combined results of the screening and diagnostic portions of the exam), because the screening and subsequent additional imaging will have been completed in a single visit. However, the screening portion of the exam should be assigned a category 0 for audit purposes. (For further information please refer to the Auditing and Outcomes Monitoring section on page 801.)

Under unusual circumstances, assessment category 0 may be used in a diagnostic US report, such as when equipment or personnel are not immediately available to perform a needed concurrent diagnostic mammography examination, or when the patient is unable or unwilling to wait for completion of a full diagnostic examination. Category 0 should *rarely* be used for diagnostic breast imaging findings that warrant further evaluation with another modality such as MRI. In almost all cases, the interpreting physician should issue a final assessment and recommendation in the US report, which may be composite with diagnostic mammography. If a finding is suspicious on US, a category 0 assessment with recommendation for MRI is inappropriate, as MRI should not obviate biopsy of a sonographically suspicious finding.

Category 0: Incomplete: Need prior imaging for comparison, category 0 should also be used when prior imaging is unavailable for comparison. This category 0 assessment is appropriate only when such comparison is required to make a final assessment. If a finding is inherently suspicious, awaiting prior imaging may unnecessarily delay an inevitable biopsy recommendation. When category 0 is used in the context of awaiting prior examinations for comparison, there should be in place a tracking system guaranteeing with 100% reliability that a final assessment will be issued within 30 days (preferably sooner), even if prior examinations do not become available. Some breast imaging practices may reasonably choose never to use category 0 in the context of awaiting prior examinations if they do not have a 100% reliable

tracking system. If an US examination is assessed as category 0 in the context of awaiting prior examinations and then the prior examinations do become available, an addendum to the initial US report should be issued, including revised assessment and management recommendations. For auditing purposes, the revised assessment should replace the initial assessment.</div>

                <div class="document-content">When describing abnormal-appearing internal mammary lymph nodes it is helpful to provide the side and intercostal space number by defining the ribs above and below the lymph node (e.g., intercostal space between ribs 1 and 2). This may facilitate correlation with other imaging or aid in targeted radiation therapy.

For abnormal-appearing internal mammary lymph nodes in the setting of known breast malignancy or findings suspicious for breast malignancy, the lymph nodes should be fully described but they should not be given a separate BI-RADS assessment. If not biopsy-proven metastatic, management often depends on multiple clinical factors and preferences.

For abnormal-appearing internal mammary lymph nodes that are an isolated finding, they should be given a BI-RADS assessment based on the level of suspicion for lymph node malignancy.

Example wording which could be used for abnormal-appearing internal mammary lymph nodes in the different settings includes:</div>

Without patient specific data on initial MOD, national organizations, such as the USPSTF, ACS, and American College of Physicians (ACP), when examining the impact of screening, still turn to models based on historic data and variable assumptions that are subject to bias [48, 49, 52]. The lack of contemporary, patient-specific information has permitted ongoing speculation and fostered disagreement about the risks and benefits of screening in the U.S. leading to conflicting recommendations, which confuse patients and providers and foster missed opportunities to save lives [51, 52].</div>

                <div class="document-content">The Lexicon structure was updated, and there are multiple updated descriptors and sections.

The term focus has been removed from the lexicon for multiple reasons. Most small dots of enhancement are benign and should appropriately be dismissed as benign. Further, for a truly unique enhancing finding  $\leq 5$  mm in size, modern MRI techniques should allow characterization as a small mass (meets criteria/features of a mass) or focal NME (does not meet criteria/features of a mass). There has also been inconsistent understanding and use of the term focus in clinical practice and in the literature. Future research should investigate the predictive morphologic and kinetic features of such small masses and NME, optimally in multi-site prospective studies.

The mass margin previously "irregular" was changed to indistinct for better harmonization with the mammography and ultrasound mass margin descriptors and to avoid confusion with its use as a shape descriptor as well.

The new mass descriptor of T2 signal intensity was added. Based on expert opinion and existing data, a T2 hyperintense mass that is also oval and circumscribed and demonstrates homogeneous internal enhancement or dark internal septations has a low probability of malignancy of  $\leq 2\%$  [6]. Therefore, T2 signal intensity should be assessed and specifically reported when it influences assessments and recommendations.

The new associated feature of peritumoral edema was added. This is hyperintense T2 signal in the tissue surrounding a malignant or suspicious finding. It may suggest a malignant etiology of the finding, and for extensive malignancies is associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastases [12]. However, this finding can also be present as post-biopsy change or due to other benign etiologies.

Regional lymph nodes when abnormal were previously categorized as an associated feature ("lymph-adenopathy). Due to the importance of detailed description of abnormal lymph nodes, "lymph nodes" was added as separate category across modalities. For breast MRI, the nodes to be assessed are those which are routinely seen on breast MRI, which are the intramammary, axillary, and internal mammary lymph nodes.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Intramammary lymph nodes may exist throughout the breast, but they are most commonly seen in the upper outer quadrant and in the posterior third (especially the axillary tail). They may be seen adjacent to blood vessels. The usual size of normal intramammary lymph nodes ranges from 3 to 4 mm up to approximately 1 cm, but they may be larger. Given their usual small size, the echogenic fat may be challenging to visualize. Use of Doppler imaging is helpful in such situations to identify the hilum, where the afferent artery and efferent vein reside. When the classic features of an intramammary lymph node are depicted, the finding may be considered benign. However, breast cancer may metastasize to intramammary lymph nodes, in which case they may be enlarged and appear round or irregular. Metastases to intramammary lymph nodes are considered the same as metastases to axillary level I nodes in TNM staging.

                <div class="document-content">Category 1: No evidence of malignancy. Recommend routine breast screening, including MRI if appropriate according to guidelines.

Overall, each breast is coded according to the highest order actionable BI-RADS assessment category for that breast. In this example, the overall right breast assessment is category 4B, and the overall left breast assessment is category 1. Overall, the examination is coded according to the highest order BI-RADS assessment category across both breasts. In this example, the overall examination is coded category 4B.

As described in the Auditing and Outcomes Monitoring section, examinations with a category 6 as highest order actionable assessment should not be counted as additional cancers in breast imaging audits. Because the diagnosis of malignancy already has been established, inclusion of these cases would skew the data for many performance parameters.

Ultrasound For Suspicious Breast MRI Findings

When additional imaging with ultrasound is recommended for breast MRI findings, the term "second-look" ultrasound should be avoided, as it implies that a "first-look" ultrasound has been performed. The terms "targeted," "MRI-targeted," "directed," or "MRI-directed" ultrasound should be used.

For suspicious MRI findings, the decision to initially recommend ultrasound and ultrasound-guided tissue sampling rather than immediately recommending MRI-guided tissue sampling should be based on the published likelihoods of ultrasound detection for particular MRI findings, the potential challenges to MRI-guided sampling, and practice considerations such as access time for MRI-guided procedures.

A systematic review and metanalysis showed that the overall rate of ultrasound detection of MRI findings was heterogeneous across studies, ranging from 23% to 82%, with a pooled rate of 58% [42]. Detection was more frequent for masses with a pooled detection rate of 66% than for NME with a pooled rate of 29%. Study results regarding the impact of findings sizes on detection rates have been mixed. Based on the relatively low NME detection rate it is particularly reasonable to immediately recommend MRI-guided tissue sampling for NME.

For findings that would be challenging to sample using MRI due to location or the presence of breast implants, there should be a lower threshold for initially recommending ultrasound and ultrasound-guided tissue sampling.

Ultrasound findings should definitively correlate to the MRI findings in order to undergo ultrasound-guided tissue sampling, unless there are no or limited options for MRI sampling. This is important to avoid a falsely reassuring negative ultrasound biopsy of the incorrect location.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Macrocalcifications are large enough to attenuate the US beam and are typically associated with posterior shadowing [37]. Common macrocalcifications identified on US may be due to degenerating fibroadenomas, oil cysts, or dystrophic calcifications. Postsurgical clips can also mimic the appearance of macrocalcifications with posterior shadowing. In these scenarios, correlation with mammography is essential to rule out the possibility of a small suspicious shadowing mass.

Figure 1 – MACROCALCIFICATIONS. (A) Ultrasound shows coarse echogenic MACROCALCIFICATION associated with posterior shadowing within echogenic glandular tissue. The curvilinear hyperechoic line along the superficial margin is characteristic of MACROCALCIFICATIONS. An adjacent smaller echogenic MACROCALCIFICATION (arrow) is too small to attenuate the US beam, so there is no posterior shadowing. (B) Mammography shows the corresponding calcifications plus numerous additional calcifications that were not identified on US.

                <div class="document-content">All CEM examinations should include a management recommendation. If the assessment is incomplete (category 0), a specific suggestion for the next course of action should be rendered. This could include obtaining prior mammograms or performing additional imaging such as ultrasound or MRI. If additional imaging is recommended, the current report should proactively and clearly specify the recommended course of action in the scenario where the additional imaging proves to be negative or equivocal. With few exceptions, the management recommendations should be linked to the assessment category as described below.

However, there are many sonographic masses that are not strictly oval, round, or irregular, and we are thus re-introducing a term that more specifically describes a mass which is generally oval in shape but displays surface undulations, also applicable in mammography and MRI. The term "lobulated" will be used rather than "lobular" (with intention to avoid confusion with lobular carcinoma,

especially as perceived by any lay person reading the report). "Lobulated" is a shape descriptor for a mass, designed to communicate most specifically what the mass looks like. The term is insufficiently specific at ultrasound to establish benignity or diagnose malignancy but does convey a slight increase in suspicion compared to an oval mass.</div>

                <div class="document-content">All types of asymmetries have different contours than true masses and often lack the conspicuity of masses. Indeed, asymmetries appear similar to other discrete areas of benign fibroglandular tissue except that they are unilateral, with no mirror-image correlate in the opposite breast. An asymmetry demonstrates a concave contour and is usually interspersed with fat, whereas a mass demonstrates a completely or partially convex contour and (when radiodense) appears denser in the center than at the periphery.

Historically, a mass (by definition) had to be visualized on two orthogonal mammographic projections, and, if visualized only in one projection, was classified as an asymmetry. New to this version, if a one-view finding demonstrates the characteristic features of a mass (e.g., convex contour and central radiodensity), it may be appropriate to classify it as a mass. True masses may be seen on only one view due to masking by overlapping fibroglandular tissue or exclusion from the image field. One-view only masses may be more apparent on DBT.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Masses on LE images may have associated enhancement on RC images. It is important to recognize that the presence of enhancement does not necessarily mean that the mass is malignant. Several benign entities can be associated with an enhancing mass including fibroadenoma, papilloma, and

radial scar. When determining management strategies for these enhancing masses, it is important to use information from both the LE and RC images. If the mass has suspicious features on LE images, such as having irregular margin or increased density, or having developed over time, the finding should be viewed with suspicion. On the other hand, should the mass be stable over time with circumscribed margin, further evaluation may not be necessary.

Masses on LE images may also be absent of enhancement. Similar to MRI, non-enhancing masses are usually benign. Masses that have a thin rim of enhancement but are otherwise associated with decreased enhancement relative to surrounding breast tissue are typically benign. This imaging appearance is termed the 'eclipse sign' or negative contrast enhancement and is classic for benign cysts [10].

However, it may not be possible to definitively say that a mass is non-enhancing in the setting of moderate or marked BPE. Remember that CEM is a planar exam, and the RC images reflect enhancement occurring throughout the breast. While the mass itself may not be enhancing, it may appear to have enhancing portions due to superimposed enhancing breast parenchyma. In this circumstance, the RC images are not helpful in classifying the mass as benign or malignant and ultrasound or possibly MRI may be necessary for further characterization.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Although ipsilateral mammography after mastectomy is usually not indicated, imaging of the reconstructed breast or mastectomy site may be required to evaluate a clinical finding (i.e., a palpable finding). As with any mammographic report, breast density should be recorded in the mastectomy patient. When only the mastectomy side is imaged, breast density should be assigned based on the tissue present. Usually, the tissue is almost entirely fatty and therefore BI-RADS breast composition category A is appropriate. However, occasionally some breast tissue remains (e.g., skin-sparing mastectomies and subtotal mastectomies) and therefore denser breast composition categories may be appropriate. It is often difficult to image a mastectomy patient due to the minimal amount of residual tissue, especially in patients without reconstruction. Therefore, only limited views of the area of concern (e.g., spot tangential) may be obtained. These mammographic views can be critical as benign fat necrosis is a common finding in mastectomy patients. On ultrasound, fat necrosis may appear as an irregular, shadowing, suspicious mass and result in an unnecessary biopsy if the mammographic view is not obtained.

# J. LOCATION OF FINDING

The location of a salient finding should be described to facilitate easy identification in the future and correlation with clinical findings. The laterality of the finding as left or right should always be reported. The position of the finding within the breast should be described by quadrant and/or clock face. For findings seen on only one view, it may not be possible to provide this level of precision. For findings seen predominantly on DBT, the slice number should be provided for all views to ensure that the finding can be accurately reidentified prior to further imaging. Depth or distance from the nipple to the center of the finding should be reported. If the finding is large, distance to its anterior and posterior extents can be included. Also, it may be helpful to describe the anatomic zone where the finding lies to facilitate lesion identification when correlating among modalities. For example, noting that a mass lies at the subcutaneous fat-fibroglandular zone junction may allow easier search and more confident identification when ultrasound evaluation is undertaken.

Finding location should be described by laterality first, followed by clock face and/or quadrant, and then depth or distance from the nipple. The following are examples of a finding location description:

Right breast, upper outer quadrant, anterior depth Left breast, 3:00, 5 cm from the nipple

- If a patient presents with clinical signs and symptoms of breast cancer such as a palpable lump or nipple discharge, and the imaging test shows a suspicious finding, then the MOD in the diagnostic BI-RADS category 4 or 5 report is Pat.
- 2. If a patient presents with signs and symptoms of breast cancer and the imaging test shows a finding that is completely distinct from the symptom (i.e. contralateral breast or clearly different location in the ipsilateral breast) and it is suspicious, then the MOD would still be category Pat because the patient's symptom triggered the work-up and the objective of tracking MOD is to understand the impact of screening mammography. The examination in this scenario is not a screening examination, therefore, a screening MOD cannot be applied. Example: A woman presents with a palpable mass in the right breast which turns out to be a cyst. Diagnostic mammography shows a suspicious finding in the asymptomatic left (contralateral) breast, then the MOD in the BI-RADS category 4 or 5 report for the left breast is category Pat because the incidental finding prompting cancer diagnosis would not have been detected had it not been for the patient's symptom.
- 3. If a provider performing a clinical examination detects a sign (lump, retraction, ridge) in an asymptomatic patient, that prompts diagnostic work-up and tissue sampling is recommended, then MOD is Pro.
- 4. If it is unclear if the patient presented to a provider with a symptom or a provider first detected a sign on clinical exam or questioning, then the MOD, when the patient undergoes subsequent diagnostic imaging with a BI-RADS category 4 or 5 result, is Ppp.</div>

Example: if a screening DBT mammogram and US are performed on the same day and a finding on the screening mammogram is given a BI-RADS category 0 assessment and the US is given a BI-RADS category 1 or 2 assessment, and biopsy is recommended at the subsequent work up, then the MOD in the diagnostic BI-RADS category 4 or 5 report is Sdbt.
- 2. Two screening examinations (e.g. screening mammogram and screening US or MRI) are performed on the same day and the finding is equally and independently identified on both examinations and both examinations are classified as BI-RADS category 0 in separate reports. A biopsy is recommended at subsequent work-up. In this case, the primary screening examination should be recorded as the MOD. Because screening mammography is the primary screening exam and US and MRI are considered supplemental, the mammogram is the MOD. Example: A 2D mammogram and MRI are performed on the same day and a BI-RADS category 0 is assigned to a finding seen equally on both modalities. The subsequent work-up with ultrasound and mammography confirms a suspicious finding. The MOD in the diagnostic BI-RADS category 4 or 5 report should be category Sma rather than Smri.

- 3. Two screening examinations are performed on the same day and reported together but the finding is initially seen only on one of them. Example: A suspicious mass is seen on screening US first and seen in retrospect on the DBT screening mammogram. A single report recommending additional imaging is issued. Subsequent work-up confirms a suspicious mass. The MOD in the diagnostic BI-RADS category 4 or 5 report is category Sus.
- 4. If two screening examinations are performed on separate days, the MOD is assigned for the modality on which the cancer was *initially* identified chronologically, regardless of whether the finding is identified on both exams or how it is seen at the time of diagnostic work-up.
- 5. Other types of special screening examinations, such as those described as "diagnostic" but performed on asymptomatic women following a clinical history of breast cancer or benign breast biopsy or breast augmentation, are included in the screening group for audit purposes. This is consistent with the audit guidelines in the BI-RADS Manual. Findings detected initially on these examinations in asymptomatic women should also be categorized as screening for the purposes of MOD. Example: A suspicious finding is initially detected on a yearly 2D mammogram (no DBT images) in an asymptomatic woman with an indication of prior history of breast cancer treated 3 years ago. The subsequent work-up confirms a suspicious finding. The MOD in the diagnostic BI-RADS category 4 or 5 report is category Sma.
- 6. BI-RADS category 3: If a BI-RADS category 3 finding is stable and benign and never progresses to BI-RADS category 4 or 5 assessment, and tissue sampling is never recommended, the MOD will never be assigned. But if a BI-RADS category 3 is reassessed as BI-RADS category 4 or 5 on diagnostic surveillance imaging, then the radiologist would code the MOD on that BI-RADS category 4 or 5 diagnostic report. MOD is based on complete review of imaging history back to initial screening or diagnostic examination that detected the finding and triggered the follow-up. Example: If the initial examination related to this finding was a BI-RADS category 3 when a 24-year-old patient presented with a palpable lump characterized as oval, parallel, circumscribed and homogeneously hypoechoic (presumed fibroadenoma), that grew at 12-month follow-up with biopsy now recommended, then it is coded Pat. If a baseline screening tomosynthesis mammogram with synthetic views was a BI-RADS category 0 for calcifications, followed by BI-RADS category 3 on the immediate recall diagnostic examination, and then BI-RADS category 4 at the 6-month short interval follow-up, then initial MOD is coded Sdbt for the first examination (Sdbt) that triggered the work-up and follow-up.
- 7. Initial MOD should be assigned to screening MRI or targeted ultrasounds after screening MRI only in patients without an active diagnosis of cancer. If a finding on screening MRI is assessed as BI-RADS category 4 or 5 and tissue sampling and targeted ultrasound are recommended, Smri should be assigned as the MOD. If the targeted ultrasound is negative (BI-RADS category 1) and MR-guided breast biopsy is recommended because the MRI finding is suspicious, the MOD will already have been assigned on the MRI (MOD could be carried over to the ultrasound as Smri but it is not required). If a finding on screening MRI is assessed as BI-RADS category 0 because the finding may be able to be definitively characterized as benign or suspicious on targeted ultrasound, MOD is not assigned in the MRI report. If the final assessment from the targeted ultrasound is BI-RADS category 4 or 5 and tissue sampling is recommended, then MOD should be assigned in the diagnostic ultrasound report as per usual guidelines which would be Smri.
- 8. MOD should not be assigned to examinations after tissue sampling has established the diagnosis of cancer. Any mammogram, ultrasound, MRI or other imaging modality employed to further evaluate the extent of disease or staging does not require an MOD. The diagnosis of cancer has already been established and MOD is no longer prospective.

- MOD should not be assigned to an MRI performed to evaluate the extent of disease. The
  diagnosis of cancer has already been established and the assignment of MOD is no longer
  prospective. In the vast majority of cases, MOD will have been assigned on prior diagnostic
  examinations when tissue sampling was recommended.
- 10. To remain consistent, MOD should not be assigned to targeted ultrasound examinations recommended after MRI for extent of disease. The diagnosis of cancer has already been established and the assignment of MOD is no longer prospective. In the vast majority of cases, MOD will have been assigned on prior diagnostic examinations when tissue sampling was recommended.</div>

The term focus has been removed from the lexicon for multiple reasons. Most small dots of enhancement are benign and should appropriately be dismissed as benign. Further, for a truly unique enhancing finding  $\leq 5$  mm in size, modern MRI techniques typically allow characterization as a small mass (meets criteria/features of a mass) or focal NME (does not meet criteria/features of a mass). There has also been inconsistent understanding and use of the term focus in clinical practice and in the literature. Future research should investigate the predictive morphologic and kinetic features of such small masses and NME, optimally in multi-site prospective studies.</div>

There is a second mass on diagnostic examination in the contralateral (right) breast that is also suspicious (BI-RADS category 4 or 5) with a recommendation for bilateral tissue diagnosis. Both the palpable mass and the contralateral nonpalpable mass are biopsied. The palpable mass is benign, and the contralateral nonpalpable mass is malignant. The diagnostic interpretation, for the bilateral examination, is positive (BI-RADS category 4 or 5) and the diagnostic examination is classified as true-positive (TP) because malignancy is diagnosed within 1 year of the suspicious assessment. Note that the MQSA Final Rule requires only a single overall assessment for both breasts for all mammography examinations [1]. Therefore, for most mammography facilities, which do not capture separate breast assessments, this examination would be classified as true-positive (TP). However, the FDA has approved an alternative standard which, under certain circumstances, allows a mammography facility to report separate assessments for each breast rather than a combined assessment for both breasts [42]. Thus, mammography facilities that choose to report separate breast assessments under the alternative FDA standard would record more clinically meaningful although less favorable outcomes data.

- 18. A patient presents with a palpable mass in the left breast that is suspicious (BI-RADS category 4 or 5) on diagnostic examination. The diagnostic mammography examination is also suspicious (BI-RADS category 4 or 5) for a mass in the contralateral (right) breast. The palpable mass is biopsied and is found to be malignant. The right breast mass is biopsied, is found to be concordantly benign, and no breast cancer is diagnosed in this breast within 1 year of diagnostic examination. The diagnostic interpretation is positive (BI-RADS category 4) for the breast in which no breast cancer is found within 1 year of examination, and the interpretation also is positive (BI-RADS category 4 or 5) for the breast in which breast cancer indeed is diagnosed within 1 year. Thus, the diagnostic interpretation is classified as false-positive (FP) for the right breast and as true-positive (TP) for the left breast. Note that the MQSA Final Rule requires only a single overall assessment for both breasts for all mammography examinations [1]. Therefore, for most mammography facilities, which do not capture separate breast assessments, this examination would be classified as true-positive (TP) because the overall positive interpretation matches the subsequent cancer diagnosis. However, the FDA has approved an alternative standard which, under certain circumstances, allows a mammography facility to report separate assessments for each breast rather than a combined assessment for both breasts [42]. Thus, mammography facilities that choose to report separate breast assessments under the alternative FDA standard would record more clinically meaningful although less favorable outcomes data.
- 19. A patient has a finding on unilateral diagnostic mammography examination that is assessed as suspicious (BI-RADS category 4) and benign at biopsy, but an unsuspected cancer is palpated and diagnosed elsewhere in the same breast within 1 year of the diagnostic examination. All mammography facilities, including those that capture separate breast assessment data, would classify the first examination as *true-positive (TP)* because cancer was diagnosed within the breast within 1 year of the positive (BI-RADS category 4) assessment, even though interpretation of the suspicious but benign finding was *false-positive (FP)* and interpretation of the unrecognized finding of cancer was *false-negative (FN)*. The FDA does not allow individual assessments of abnormal findings to replace a breast-level assessment in the mammography report. However, if a mammography facility chooses to collect and audit finding-level data, the resultant audit outcomes will be more clinically meaningful, albeit less favorable.</div>

Other sequences such as T2-weighted images may demonstrate the mass, due to signal characteristics that differentiate it from the surrounding tissue. These non-enhancing solid masses are distinguished from cysts as they do not contain fluid. Non-enhancing masses are benign, other than in specific circumstances such as a known biopsy-proven malignancy after neoadjuvant systemic therapy that persists as a mass but does not enhance after treatment.

                <div class="document-content">As newer modalities (such as MRI, CEM and MBI) become increasingly common in clinical practice, findings (some of which are cancers) heretofore unseen are being detected. This development has resulted in the rising utilization of ultrasound as an adjunctive modality to target these types of sometimes subtle finding(s) seen on the other modalities, not only to further characterize but also to serve as potential biopsy guidance. The use of ultrasound to target potential lesions initially detected at other modalities, coupled with the improvement in ultrasound technology and high-resolution transducers, has resulted in the increased identification of sonographic findings of clinical significance that do not meet the definition of a mass. Hence, we are introducing a new category of sonographic findings in this version of BI-RADS, termed "non-mass lesion," akin to the non-mass enhancement that is seen at MRI or CEM. Though the terminology is new to this version of BI-RADS,

the concept and even the descriptor have been clinically used by some practitioners for many years. It is important to note that a non-mass lesion is not simply heterogeneous breast tissue. A non-mass lesion should be a distinct anatomic entity, imaged reproducibly by different operators and, not infrequently, correlated with a finding at mammography, MRI, or CEM. With the codification of this category of lesions in BI-RADS, additional data can be collected and analyzed about its significance in clinical practice.</div>

                <div class="document-content">- 12. A patient has a mammography screening examination at a facility in which the examination is interpreted before the patient leaves the premises, so that additional imaging can be performed immediately if needed. A noncalcified asymmetry is seen in one breast, only on the craniocaudal view. The interpreting radiologist obtains a second craniocaudal view to clarify the significance of this asymmetry. The examination is then interpreted as negative because the asymmetry (judged to represent a summation artifact) is not visible on the repeat craniocaudal view. No breast cancer is found within 1 year of examination. This sequence of performing standard screening views with interpretation followed by acquisition of additional, non-standard views, represents a positive screening examination (BI-RADS category 0), for which the woman was recalled for additional diagnostic imaging that resulted in a negative (BI-RADS category 1) assessment. Thus, the screening component of this examination should be classified as false-positive (FP) and the diagnostic component of the examination should be classified as true-negative (TN). Note that whenever a screening examination is interpreted before the patient leaves the premises, the acquisition of additional views to clarify a mammographic finding identified on standard screening satisfies the definition of a separate diagnostic examination. Therefore, this single patient visit should be considered to have a positive screening interpretation (BI-RADS category 0) and a negative (BI-RADS category 1) diagnostic interpretation.
- 13. A patient has a breast US screening examination using a handheld transducer. Images are acquired and interpreted while the patient waits. The sonographer saves an image to document a focal area of posterior acoustic shadowing during the screening examination. The interpreting physician reviews the examination. The sonographer proceeds to scan the patient to further evaluate the finding and acquires and archives one or more images to demonstrate that the focal area of shadowing is normal and not reproducible. The completed examination is then interpreted as negative because the initially depicted finding is judged to be an artifact rather than a true abnormality. This sequence of performing a standard screening examination with interpretation, followed by acquiring additional, non-standard views, meets the precise definition of a positive screening examination followed by creation of a diagnostic examination. Therefore, this single patient visit should be considered to have a positive screening interpretation (BI-RADS category 0) and a negative (BI-RADS category 1) diagnostic interpretation. If breast cancer is not diagnosed within 1 year, the screening is audited as false-positive (FP), and the diagnostic examination is true-negative (TN).
- 14. A patient has a breast US screening examination using a handheld transducer. Images are acquired and interpreted while the patient waits. One of the screening images includes a finding that may represent a cyst or mass. The interpreting physician reviews the examination. The interpreting physician proceeds to scan the patient to further evaluate the finding and acquires and archives one or more images to demonstrate that it is a simple cyst. The completed examination is then interpreted as benign. This sequence of performing a standard screening examination with interpretation, followed by acquiring additional, non-standard views, meets the precise definition of a positive screening examination followed by creation of a diagnostic examination. Therefore, this single patient visit should be considered to have a positive screening interpretation (BI-RADS category 0) and a benign (BI-RADS category 2) diagnostic interpretation. If breast cancer is not diagnosed within 1 year, the screening is audited as false-positive (FP) and the diagnostic examination is true-negative (TN). Note that in the provided scenario, had the interpreting physician determined that the initially depicted finding was a characteristically benign simple cyst without additional evaluation or image acquisition, the completed screening examination would have contained only standard images, been assessed as negative (BI-RADS category 2), and therefore been audited as true-negative (TN). Also note that the approach of not permanently archiving additional

- images upon rescanning may subject the interpreting physician to malpractice exposure if breast cancer subsequently is diagnosed at the site of the depicted finding and the only saved image depicts an abnormality.
- 15. A patient has a breast US screening examination using a handheld transducer. Images are acquired and interpreted while the patient waits. A finding that is characteristic of a simple cyst is visible on one of the standard images saved by the sonographer as part of the screening examination. The interpreting physician decides to immediately scan the patient and verifies that the finding indeed is a simple cyst but does not acquire or archive any additional images. The simple cyst is described in the screening report, and the completed examination is assessed as benign (BI-RADS category 2). No breast cancer is found within 1 year of examination. Because no additional (diagnostic) images were acquired or archived, the examination is audited purely as a screening examination and classified as true-negative (TN). Note that in standard clinical practice, the presence of one or more characteristically benign findings does not require full and permanent documentation by diagnostic imaging because 1) the likelihood of malignancy is essentially zero, and 2) the fully documented appearance of the finding(s) will not be needed for future comparison, because a) if the finding(s) again appear characteristically benign at a subsequent examination, interval change in size would be irrelevant, and b) if the finding(s) do not appear characteristically benign, biopsy would be recommended. Finally, note that even though characteristically benign finding(s) are depicted on standard screening view(s) in an asymptomatic patient, the interpreting physician may reasonably decide not to describe the finding(s) in the breast imaging report, instead rendering a negative (BI-RADS category 1) assessment.</div>

                <div class="document-content">A primary benefit of CEM is the ability to detect lesions based on vascularity that would otherwise not be seen on conventional mammography or tomosynthesis. However, managing RC image-only enhancement on CEM can be challenging. Unlike MRI that has multiple sequences that help characterize abnormalities as benign or malignant, RC images often only provide binary information as to

whether enhancement is present or not. As of this publication, additional features of RC image-only enhancement such as margin, distribution, and internal enhancement characteristics are often not specific enough to differentiate benign from malignant. As a result, it can be difficult to determine which RC image-only enhancement requires additional imaging work-up. In addition, RC image-only enhancement may be difficult to localize on two views. This can further complicate the diagnostic evaluation. The suggestions below can be used to help navigate some of these circumstances.

To start, the CEM lexicon should be used to describe the RC image-only enhancement as a mass, non-mass enhancement, or enhancing asymmetry. This enhancement should then be directly correlated with the LE images to see whether there is any associated abnormality. If there is a LE correlate, then it can be used to help determine the probability of malignancy. If the LE correlate is new, then the enhancement remains indeterminate. On the other hand, if the LE correlate has been present over many years and the LE appearance is morphologically benign, then the enhancement can be classified as benign. If a LE correlate is not clearly noted, it may also be useful to correlate with additional mammographic views and ultrasound.

In addition, it is worth evaluating how the RC image-only enhancement compares with background parenchymal enhancement. As mentioned earlier, it should be determined whether the enhancement is asymmetric between breasts or whether it is more conspicuous or discrete than the BPE. If this is the case, then the enhancement should be viewed as suspicious and further evaluated. A first step in further evaluation of an enhancing finding could be ultrasound. If, however, there is continued uncertainty with how to manage RC image-only enhancement, the best approach is to analogize to breast MRI. Published data have shown that findings on MRI and CEM have a similar appearance [12,13,14]. For this reason, when unsure how to handle incidental enhancement, consider how a similar finding might be handled on breast MRI and follow that plan.</div>

                <div class="document-content">It is important to remember that CEM is made up of LE and RC images. The report, management plan, and BI-RADS assessment should include an interpretation of both. If a suspicious abnormality is seen on either the LE or the RC images, it should be pursued with additional diagnostic evaluation. For example, if there is a suspicious morphologic finding noted on LE images (mass, distortion, calcifications) this should be further evaluated, even in the absence of enhancement. Similarly, RC image-only enhancement without a LE correlate should be pursued.</div>

                <div class="document-content">The FDA regulations require that a single overall assessment [32] or a separate assessment for each breast [54, 57] be rendered for every mammographic examination. If a single overall assessment is provided, the assessment is rendered for the more abnormal of the two breasts, based on the same hierarchy of decreasing abnormality described previously (categories 5, 4, 0, 6, 3, 2, 1). For example, if there is a probably benign assessment for one breast and a suspicious assessment for the opposite breast, the overall assessment should be suspicious (BI-RADS category 4).

If an assessment is rendered for each breast, FDA regulations specifically require that:

- a single medical report for both breasts will be sent to the referring clinician;
- a single lay report will be sent to the patient, containing information based on what would have been the overall assessment for both breasts; and

even though separate assessments are made for each breast, the interpretation will count
as only one examination towards meeting the MQSA experience requirements and will be
billed as a single examination.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">A thorough review was made of the literature related to category 3. Based on the literature, despite heterogeneity of use across patients, clinical indications and findings, category 3 can be employed in practice with malignancy rates in the appropriate  $\leq 2\%$  range. However, caution should be used when considering category 3 for findings on non-baseline examinations, since one study showed that the category 3 malignancy rate was 2% in baseline examinations but 9% in the non-baseline setting [19]. Based on the existing data and expert practice, a mass that is oval and circumscribed and has

homogeneous internal enhancement or dark internal septations and is T2 hyperintense has a likelihood of cancer  $\leq 2\%$  and could be assessed as at most category 3. The use of category 3 for other MRI findings types should be infrequent and remains based on individual and practice experience. In addition, it is now specified across modalities that in the setting of examinations obtained for current breast cancer, imaging findings which might be assessed as category 3 in other clinical scenarios should be assigned category 4A. This is because the goal of breast MRI for current cancer is to establish the extent of malignancy in the near-term to guide management decisions.

General concepts were included to provide guidance and consistency distinguishing category 6 from additional suspicious findings. Category 6 should be used for enhancing findings that are definitively the biopsy-proven malignancy based on correlation with the comparison imaging. It should also be used for enhancing findings that are more extensive than expected on correlative studies but for which there is a high certainty of malignancy, typically because they are contiguous with or the same morphology as the biopsy-proven malignancy. Category 6 may also be used for separate additional close findings (ACFs) that are suspicious but not definitively malignancy when all of the following criteria are met: 1) They are within 2 cm of the biopsy-proven malignancy, 2) They do not increase the total extent by more than 2 cm, and 3) It is felt they would not change clinical management such as prompting a significantly larger surgery. Whether such findings would impact management will be influenced by multiple factors including extent of the known breast cancer and preferences and patterns in a particular practice. The ACFs should be fully reported including sizes and relationships relative to the biopsy-proven malignancy. The term "satellite" should not be used for such findings, as it is not sufficiently defined including level of concern for malignancy and proximity to the primary malignancy. Other separate suspicious breast findings that do not meet the criteria (high certainty of malignancy or ACF) above should typically be given a separate assessment of category 0, 4 or 5, as appropriate based on their appearances.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Appropriate and consistent use of the standardized terminology is fundamental in achieving quality reports. The BI-RADS approach to reporting breast imaging examinations categorizes the overall composition of the breast and then describes masses by their shape, orientation, margin, echo patterns, and posterior features. In this version, the non-mass lesion is introduced, and such lesions may be described by their distribution, echo pattern, and any associated features. The findings are then evaluated and an assessment determined that includes the degree of suspicion for malignancy. Finally, the report indicates the pertinent management recommendation(s). Thus, the breast US report should be divided into:

- 1. INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION
- 2. COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS EXAMINATION(S), IF ANY
- 3. STATEMENT OF SCOPE AND TECHNIQUE OF BREAST US EXAMINATION
- SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL BREAST COMPOSITION (whole-breast ultrasound only)
- 5. CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF ANY IMPORTANT FINDINGS
- 6. COMPOSITE REPORTS, IF APPLICABLE
- 7. ASSESSMENT
- 8. MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Note: Assessment and management may be uncoupled from each other.

Note: Breast ultrasound examination may be reported in combination with mammography as a combined report, or it may be reported as a stand-alone examination. Whether in combination with mammography or not, the structure of the report should follow the general guidelines to ensure clarity and effectiveness.</div>

The biopsy is concordantly benign, and breast cancer is not diagnosed within 1 year of the screening examination. The screening interpretation is positive (BI-RADS category 0). The diagnostic interpretation also is positive (BI-RADS category 4 or 5). Both the screening and diagnostic examinations are classified as false-positive (FP) because no breast cancer is diagnosed within 1 year of the screening.

4. A patient has a screening examination for which a benign calcified fibroadenoma is described (BI-RADS category 2). A palpable mass, unrelated to the fibroadenoma, develops within 1 year of examination, is biopsied, and is found to be malignant. The screening interpretation is classified as negative (BI-RADS category 1 or 2 assessments). However, because malignancy is diagnosed within 1 year of the screening, the examination is classified as false-negative (FN).</div>

An asymptomatic patient has a diagnostic breast imaging examination following recall (BI-RADS category 0) for a noncalcified circumscribed mass identified at screening. Diagnostic mammography and targeted breast US examination show the mass to be consistent but not diagnostic of a benign cyst. The diagnostic examination is assessed as suspicious (BI-RADS category 4), and a diagnostic cyst aspiration is recommended. At US-guided aspiration, cyst fluid is obtained, and the finding is no longer visible at post-aspiration imaging. The cyst fluid is discarded. No breast cancer is diagnosed within 1 year of the screening. The screening interpretation is positive (BI-RADS category 0). The diagnostic interpretation also is positive (BI-RADS category 4), because tissue diagnosis is recommended. Both the screening and diagnostic mammogram and US are classified as false-positive (FP) because no breast cancer is diagnosed within 1 year. Note that diagnostic cyst aspiration, performed for the purpose of confirming the suspected diagnosis of cyst for cases in which mammographic and sonographic findings are not characteristically benign, is considered to represent a definitive diagnostic intervention despite the absence of a tissue retrieval and pathology analysis.
- 6. A patient with recent-onset focal unilateral breast pain has a diagnostic breast imaging examination. Diagnostic mammography and targeted breast US examination show a characteristically benign cyst at the symptomatic site. The diagnostic examination is assessed as benign (BI-RADS category 2) and routine mammography screening is recommended, but therapeutic cyst aspiration also is offered to provide symptomatic relief. At US-guided aspiration, cyst fluid is obtained, and the cyst is no longer visible at post-aspiration imaging. The cyst fluid is discarded. No breast cancer is diagnosed within 1 year. The diagnostic interpretation is negative (BI-RADS category 2). The diagnostic examination is classified as truenegative (TN) because no breast cancer is diagnosed within the year. Note that therapeutic cyst aspiration, performed for characteristically benign cysts to provide symptomatic relief of focal pain or tenderness, is not considered to represent a diagnostic intervention because the procedure is neither recommended nor required for diagnostic purposes.</div>

                <div class="document-content">The primary finding is the abnormality that drives the BI-RADS recommendation and management. Secondary findings are those additional abnormalities present in association with the primary finding. For example, there is a suspicious mass (primary finding) for which an ultrasound-guided biopsy is recommended, but there are also calcifications (secondary finding) within the mass. Alternatively, there are suspicious calcifications (primary finding) for which a stereotactic biopsy is recommended, but there is also a subtle asymmetry (secondary finding) overlapping the calcifications. In contrast, associated features are those changes to the breast that occur as a result of the primary and secondary findings, such as skin retraction or trabecular thickening. The use of primary and secondary findings as well as associated features, when appropriate, allows for a more nuanced description of the imaging presentation of abnormalities.

# USE OF FDA ALTERATIVE STANDARD #26-ISSUING A REPORT WITH A BREAST DENSITY ASSESSMENT THAT IS PHRASED IN THE SINGULAR, OR IS NEITHER SINGULAR NOR PLURAL

In July 2025, the FDA approved Alternative Standard #26 to amend the original MQSA standard 21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(vi) which allows the interpreting physician to provide an overall assessment of breast density that is phrased in the singular phrasing. The singular phrasing is intended to be used in reports of unilateral mammograms. The new approved terminology, outlined in 21 CFR 900.12(c) Medical records and mammography reports – (1) Contents and terminology... (https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/regulations-mqsa/mqsa-alternative-standard-26-issuing-report-breast-density-assessment-phrased-singular-or-neither), is as follows:

- (vi) Overall assessment of breast density, classified in one of the following categories:
- (A) "The breast is almost entirely fatty."
- (B) "There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density."
- (C) "The breast is heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses."

- (D) "The breast is extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography."
- (E) "Breast Density: Almost entirely fatty"
- (F) "Breast Density: Scattered areas of fibroglandular density"
- (G) "Breast Density: Heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses"
- (H) "Breast Density: Extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography"

In communicating mammography results to patients, similar singular terminology may be used, outlined in detail on the FDA website.

                <div class="document-content">The diagnosis and management of cystic breast lesions are addressed in detail in the Guidance section. A simple cyst has the following features: it is circumscribed, round or oval, anechoic (not hypoechoic), thin walled, and often shows posterior enhancement. When all four features are depicted, this establishes the diagnosis of simple cyst, a characteristically benign finding.

**Figure 1** – SPECIAL CASES: SIMPLE CYST. This simple cyst is oval, anechoic, and thin-walled, and it demonstrates posterior enhancement. Note the gain is set so the subcutaneous fat appears medium gray, and the focal zone is identified in the middle one third of the cyst with good visualization of the posterior tissue including the pectoralis muscle.

Figure 2 – SPECIAL CASES: SIMPLE CYST. The radial image (A) shows anechoic, circumscribed masses, with one located superficially relative to the other. The antiradial image of the deeper mass is shown in (B), while the antiradial image of the more superficial one is depicted in (C). When masses are grouped as these cysts are, they may not all lie in the same plane, and their margins may not appear clearly defined on all images. To differentiate similar masses in close proximity, measuring the depth from the skin to the anterior aspect of the mass can be helpful.

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">The major role for screening mammography is early detection of breast cancer in asymptomatic patients. The efficacy of mammographic screening has been well established by randomized controlled trials and case-controlled studies. Significant reductions in breast cancer mortality have been achieved for patients undergoing screening mammography because mammography detects breast cancer at a smaller size and earlier stage than in control groups of patients not undergoing screening. Seven of the eight randomized control trials demonstrated mortality reduction in women who were invited to screen, with an overall 24% reduction in mortality [1]. Additionally, case-control studies have shown an even greater benefit of screening, with a decrease in death by 49% [2]. Since 1990, screening mammography has contributed to a 45.3%–58.3% reduction in age adjusted breast cancer specific mortality in the United States [3].

Mammographic screening as performed in the United States involves the performance of the mediolateral-oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) x-ray projections of each breast with film mammography, DM and/or DBT. With DBT, multiple low dose mammographic images of the breast are obtained as the x-ray tube moves across the breast in an arc. The images are then reconstructed to produce a volume rendering of the breast. A "synthetic" mammogram (SM) image may be generated from the DBT source images and appears similar to a standard DM image. Some facilities use the SM image in place of a DM image to eliminate a second exposure (i.e., DBT + SM vs DBT + DM).

Use of DBT improves cancer detection while simultaneously reducing the rate of false positive examinations by reducing the adverse effects of overlapping tissue. When used for screening, DBT decreases the recall rate by 15–37% [4–6]. Additionally, DBT increases the cancer detection rate by 1.2–2.7 per 1000 examinations, mainly for invasive breast cancer, without a significant increase in DCIS detection [4–6]. DBT also improves visualization of a lesion's margin and improves the ability to localize findings within the breast, even when a lesion is seen in only one standard mammographic projection. Additionally, the increased conspicuity and localization of lesions with DBT may obviate the need for additional diagnostic mammographic views, allowing patients to proceed directly from screening mammography to diagnostic ultrasound for finding characterization [7, 8].

By definition, screening involves imaging of an asymptomatic patient. Patients with any new and/or suspicious clinical symptoms, an incomplete prior evaluation, or requiring follow-up of previous findings should undergo diagnostic imaging regardless of patient and referring provider preference. It is important to note that screening mammography refers to the patient as a whole and not an individual breast. For example, a patient cannot have a screening mammogram on the left breast while simultaneously undergoing a diagnostic mammogram of the right breast.

The goal of screening is to identify the subset of patients who require further diagnostic imaging evaluation among the much larger group of asymptomatic patients for whom periodic (annual, per ACR recommendations) screening is recommended. In some clinical practice settings, additional mammographic images and/or adjunctive breast imaging studies will be undertaken immediately to solve a question raised on a screening examination (i.e., online screening), with that added work-up constituting a diagnostic exam. In a more common scenario, involving the "off-line" or batch reading of screening examinations, the patient will be recalled for further evaluation to be performed at a later date for a possible abnormality detected on the screening mammogram.

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">Tissue composition at ultrasound may be considered the counterpart to breast density at mammography. Yes, tissue composition may be assigned at both screening and diagnostic imaging. Of note, while assignment of breast density at mammography is mandated by federal law, there is no such mandate for breast ultrasound. Additionally, if targeted (versus whole-breast) ultrasound was performed for diagnostic indication(s), then assignment of breast density may be limited since only a portion of the breast might be imaged.

# 2. Does GTC (glandular tissue component) assessment with ultrasound only apply to women with dense breasts at mammography?

No. GTC assessment is in many ways similar to breast background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at MRI. GTC is applicable to women with dense and non-dense breasts. Larger amounts of GTC has been shown to be a potential breast cancer risk marker, independent of breast density. As such, GTC is applicable to women with dense and non-dense breasts, as is BPE on MRI.

# 3. How does one distinguish between normal heterogeneous breast tissue at ultrasound versus a non-mass lesion at ultrasound?

As with any ultrasound assessment, experience and real-time scanning help in determining a true lesion versus normal tissue. In the case of a non-mass lesion at ultrasound, the finding should be reproducible by different sonologists/sonographers and identifiable in at least two planes (even though it may be much more conspicuous in one plane). When there is a correlate on other imaging modalities (e.g., mammography, CEM, MRI), then there is strong support that the finding in question is indeed a non-mass lesion and not simply heterogeneous but otherwise normal breast tissue.</div>

7. Our institution uses cryoablation to treat breast cancers in certain settings. Can this be considered definitive therapy? Can we provide a BI-RADS 2 assessment instead of a BI-RADS 6 assessment if the imaging acquired one year after successful cryoablation appears benign?

Yes, in this version of the BI-RADS Manual, therapies other than surgery-based cancer removal can be considered definitive if viewed as such by the institutional clinical team. As a result, an exam that shows typical post-treatment changes without findings suspicious for residual/recurrent disease can accurately be assessed as category 2, benign.

8. What is the appropriate term for recommending diagnostic follow-up in one year?

The preferred term for recommending follow-up at one year is 'continued surveillance,' rather than 'short term follow-up'. Short term follow-up should be reserved for exams recommended to occur in less than the standard follow-up interval (one year).

                <div class="document-content">As with all imaging, it is important to first ensure the CEM images are technically adequate for interpretation. This includes (1) confirming contrast was appropriately administered, (2) ensuring your hanging protocol has LE images superimposed with RC images, and (3) appropriately setting window and level to reveal contrast enhancement.

To start, it is important to confirm that all of the contrast agent was safely and completely administered to the patient. Unlike breast MRI which employs a relatively small volume of gadolinium-based contrast material, CEM uses a larger quantity of an iodinated contrast agent that is administered at a dose of 1.5cc/kg with variable institutional maximums. As a result, the technologist performing the CEM should be able to visibly appreciate if contrast agent leaks from the tubing or if the patient is experiencing discomfort from contrast extravasation into their soft tissues. Any contrast event should be communicated to the responsible radiologist who will determine next steps including whether the study is interpretable. Otherwise, it is reasonable to assume that contrast has been appropriately administered to the patient and abnormal enhancement, if present, should be seen. While it is true that variations in hemodynamic blood flow could impact contrast visibility, the technical parameters of the CEM have been determined to allow for this.

The acquired CEM images could be impacted should contrast material get on a patient's skin or on the imaging equipment. Contrast contamination has the appearance of punctate hyperdensities overlying the breasts, similar to calcifications, but are often only seen on the recombined images [3,4,5]

To minimize this artifact, personnel should wash hands after handling contrast material. Alternatively, personnel can consider wearing gloves when handling the contrast material and changing or removing the gloves when performing the imaging portion of the CEM exam.

Hanging protocols for CEM can vary from institution to institution. One key element that should be maintained across sites is the superimposition of LE and RC images during viewing. This allows direct correlation of LE imaging findings with enhancement on RC images. Similarly, it allows readers to identify a LE correlate should an unexpected abnormality be seen on the RC images. Some vendor equipment has improved functionality that allows for the phasing in and out of the LE and RC images; however, this is not critical for exam review.

Lastly, a common challenge is adjusting the window and level to maximize contrast visibility. The internal contrast and brightness of the CEM images are determined at the time of acquisition. They are impacted by different conditions, such as breast tissue thickness and breast composition. Viewing workstations typically maintain the same technical parameters from acquisition and may not be optimized for interpretation. Manual adjustment of image brightness (level) and contrast (window) should be performed to improve visibility of any abnormal enhancement. A series of window and level settings may also be established so manual adjustment is less necessary.</div>

                <div class="document-content">c. Heterogeneous Background Echotexture

Heterogeneity can be either focal or diffuse. The breast echotexture is characterized by multiple small areas of relative increased and decreased echogenicity. Shadowing may occur at the interfaces of fat lobules and parenchyma. This pattern occurs in younger patients and those with heterogeneously dense parenchyma depicted mammographically. Whether and how this pattern affects the sensitivity of sonography merits additional study, but clinical experience suggests that the detection of small and subtle lesions may be confounded by heterogeneous background echotexture. Technical maneuvers may help resolve interpretive dilemmas that occasionally result in unnecessary biopsy. Different techniques, including appropriate placement of the focal zone(s), modifying the angle of insonation, and implementing compound imaging, can notably enhance characterization at diverse interfaces. To decrease the impact of shadowing caused by refraction, placing a single focal zone at the preferred depth or multiple focal zones can improve contrast resolution at varying depths. Additionally, adjusting the angle of insonation or using compound imaging can improve tissue differentiation by gathering data from multiple angles.

                <div class="document-content">The ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of a Diagnostic Breast Ultrasound Examination recommends a transducer with a broad bandwidth operating at a center frequency of at least 12 MHz and preferably higher [4]. A high-frequency ultrasound transducer provides superior contrast and spatial resolution but has less penetration. Typically, breast ultrasound is performed with the highest frequency linear transducer available. In contrast, lower frequency transducers provide greater tissue penetration but have a lower resolution. Therefore, when evaluating deep tissue in patients with large breasts, it may be helpful to select lower frequency settings for the beam to penetrate tissue and provide better characterization.

Higher frequency sound waves are more strongly attenuated by breast tissue than lower frequency waves. With proper positioning, most breasts in the supine or supine-oblique position are only a few centimeters thick, and high frequencies can provide optimal image quality for all the breast tissue.

**Figure 1** – IMAGE QUALITY: TRANSDUCER FREQUENCY. Margin and surrounding architectural distortion of this irregular mass (longitudinal view) with transducer operating at 7.2 MHz (A) is less well characterized than same mass (B) imaged at 14 MHz. Cicatrization the Cooper's ligaments is more conspicuous and the indistinct margin of the mass more confidently characterizable due to improved resolution of the higher frequency transducer. Pathology: Invasive ductal carcinoma.

**Figure 2** – IMAGE QUALITY: TRANSDUCER FREQUENCY. The image obtained with a linear transducer with frequency range of 12–5 MHz is diagnostic (A) but greatly improved with a transducer whose frequency range is 17–5 MHz (B). In both images, the microcalcifications present within ducts (arrows) in the echogenic fibroglandular zone of tissue can be seen, but resolution of these particles and the ductal anatomy is better with the higher frequency probe.

Alternatively, a greater degree of compression can improve ultrasound wave penetration and reduce attenuation of the ultrasound beam. Compression with the ultrasound probe will reduce refractive shadowing and enhance image quality.

                <div class="document-content">c. Coarse (previously "popcorn-like;" now also includes "dystrophic" - see Guidance section)

Coarse calcifications are typically large (e.g., > 2–3 mm in greatest diameter), dense, and confluent with other similar calcifications. There may be irregular margins of individual calcifications, but the prevailing appearance is a smooth margin. Historically, coarse calcifications were described as 'popcorn-like'. This term has been discontinued. Dystrophic was previously a stand-alone term that is now discontinued and is to be included under the Coarse category.

Coarse calcifications may be produced by an involuting fibroadenoma and over time may coalesce to become a single very large single calcification. An involuting fibroadenoma may or may not be associated with a mass or focal asymmetry. This category can also include coarse calcifications that form in the irradiated breast or following trauma, infection, or surgery. There may be associated lucent tissue due to fat necrosis.

There can be overlap in the appearance of the typically benign descriptor "coarse" and the suspicious descriptor "coarse heterogeneous," but coarse calcifications are typically larger with smoother margins.

No, the FDA mammography regulations do not apply to breast MRI. However, the ACR recommends using BI-RADS assessment categories for breast MRI examinations.

2. What assessment category should be used for a non-contrast breast MRI examination for implant assessment? Should such exams be audited as TP, FP, TN, or FN?

BI-RADS assessment categories are used to reflect likelihoods of breast cancer. At this time, detection of breast cancer required the use of contrast. Therefore, an examination intentionally performed with no contrast for implant assessment is not assigned assessment categories and is not included in the outcomes audit. Occasionally, a breast MRI for cancer detection will not have contrast administered due to patient or technical issues. For this scenario, the appropriate assessment would be Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation for a technically inadequate examination.

Standardized reporting facilitates clear and concise communication across disciplines and permits simultaneous data collection for future outcomes review (i.e., medical audit, tumor registry). Although not required, a structured reporting system will allow individual interpreting physicians and mammography facilities to monitor their own results and appraise the accuracy of image interpretation so that they can adjust interpretive thresholds appropriately. Note that use of ACR-approved computer-based reporting software is required for participation in the ACR National Mammography Database (NMD) (https://nrdr.acr.org/Portal/NMD/Main/page.aspx).</div>

                <div class="document-content">Over the years of continued BI-RADS usage, the Committee has received many questions related to the various sections that comprise BI-RADS. The guidance chapter addresses these concerns, introduces changes in terminology and assessments, and explains the reasons for these changes. New or expanded definitions and terminology in the lexicon and the explanation for their inclusion are added. At present, some of the changes do not have supportive data other than expert consensus; however, the Committee believes that their inclusion is necessary to make the lexicon a more practical document. As was the case with previous BI-RADS editions, data accrue in mammography literature, and as this occurs, evidence-based changes are made. In some cases, introduction of new terminology may spur investigation of outcomes and efficacy.</div>

                <div class="document-content">There is little data that supports timing of CEM during any particular phase of the menstrual cycle. For MRI, the recommendation has previously been to schedule during week 2, but several studies have shown that outcomes may not be affected by the stage of the menstrual cycle, and this may also be true for CEM.

Ready availability of personnel to start an IV line is critical to ensure timely performance of the study. To allow this, facilities should consider setting aside dedicated CEM time slots.

The usual dose of contrast for CEM will depend on the patient's body weight and the concentration of iodine in the agent used. Contrast is generally delivered with a power injector at a rate of 3 ml/sec. After a delay of approximately 2 minutes, the patient is positioned in the standard four mammography projections and two exposures are taken for each projection, one right after the other. The LE image is obtained at a kVp in the range of standard mammography, generally 28 to 32 kVp, and the high energy image typically between 45 and 49 kVp. A post-processed RC image is generated from the LE and high-energy images.

The order of the projections obtained varies with the facility. In general, for a bilateral study, the same view is alternated between the breasts so at least one view of each breast is obtained while contrast is maximally present. If there is one breast that requires particular attention, for example a case of newly diagnosed breast cancer, both views of that breast can be obtained first. Also, if it is known that an additional non-standard view of one breast is needed, for example an exaggerated CC view, it can be obtained before imaging of the contralateral breast. The total time available to obtain images before contrast washes out is between 7 to 10 minutes, so ideally the entire CEM should be performed within that time frame.</div>

                <div class="document-content">The Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) is legislation that was developed to establish minimum standards that would ensure all patients have access to quality mammography services. MQSA required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop standards that would be enforced through strict accreditation, certification and inspection of equipment and personnel at mammography facilities. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was tasked with implementing the federal regulations. The American College of Radiology (ACR) is one of three FDA-approved accreditation bodies.

Mammography reports are required to be compliant with FDA-approved wording. The FDA-approved wording uses overall assessment categories (e.g., negative, benign), but not a numeric code. The ACR provides more nuance in reporting and utilizes numeric codes and subcategories within BI-RADS (e.g., 4A, 4B), which may be helpful for practice auditing. For audit purposes, practices must comply with the FDA-approved wording.

If US is reported separately, it should be given a BI-RADS assessment based on the sonographic findings with an added statement referring to the CEM findings.

For example, if there is a mass on the CEM study and ultrasound is done at a later time and is negative, the US can be assigned a BI-RADS 1 with additional recommendation of how to manage the finding on the CEM. If ultrasound is recommended based on CEM findings and done at a later time, the CEM report should always include a management recommendation if the ultrasound is negative. In the case where a single report is issued, each exam should still be audited separately.</div>

Amorphous calcifications in a regional (if new or increasing), grouped, linear, or segmental distribution are of intermediate suspicion and generally warrant biopsy [26]. Bilateral diffuse amorphous calcifications may usually be dismissed as benign. Amorphous calcifications do not change shape between views or layer on 90° lateral (LM/ML) magnification views, as is seen with layering calcifications (see above).

However, on rare occasions, some solid masses may also appear anechoic, notably necrotic and/or triple negative breast cancers. Unlike simple cysts, the margin of anechoic malignancies is almost never circumscribed. Anechogenicity should not be confused with the marked hypoechogenicity that may be seen in some solid masses.

Figure 3 – ECHO PATTERN: ANECHOIC. Patient presented with a painful palpable lump. Radial (A) and antiradial (B) images of an oval, circumscribed, ANECHOIC mass, with no posterior features. The mass was believed to represent a simple cyst, though an echogenic rind (arrowhead) is not typically seen with a benign cyst. Aspiration performed to address the patient's pain did not yield fluid. Needle biopsy ultimately confirmed the diagnosis: Reactive intramammary lymph node.

Radial (A) and antiradial (B) images of an irregular, spiculated, markedly HYPOECHOIC mass with posterior shadowing. There is an absence of echoes in the mass centrally. However, echoes do emanate from the periphery of the mass, indicating that the mass does not fit into the anechoic category. Pathology: Diabetic mastopathy.

**Figure 5** – While this mass appears largely anechoic, it should not be considered to display benign features. The anechogenicity likely stems from profound shadowing emanating from the anterior part of the mass (and extending behind the mass, rendering the posterior mass margin invisible). This irregular, spiculated, non-parallel mass was assigned an assessment category BI-RADS 5, highly suggestive of malignancy. Pathology: Invasive lobular carcinoma.

The absence of vascularity in a solid mass suggests that it has little or no blood flow. However, technical factors such as sensitivity settings for color Doppler (pulse repetition frequency should be set for slow flow) may suppress the display of vascularity, falsely making a lesion appear avascular. Additionally, transducer pressure should be minimal, as tissue compression may inadvertently occlude small vessels and give a false avascular assessment.

Although many of these numerous calcifications have radiolucent centers, not even one calcific particle projects over the skin surface, making it unlikely that these are skin calcifications. Similar diffuse calcifications were present in the contralateral breast. Multiplicity, bilaterality, diffuse distribution, and absence of suspicious morphology should prompt a benign assessment (category 2).

Breast calcifications are radiodense calcium deposits primarily composed of calcium hydroxy-apatite and calcium oxalate. They may be associated with both benign and malignant breast lesions [17]. Calcifications assessed as benign on mammography are typically larger, coarser, rounder (with smooth margins), and more conspicuous than malignant calcifications. Calcifications associated with malignancy (but also many benign calcifications) are usually very small (< 0.5 mm) and often require the use of magnification views to be well seen. Magnification views often reveal additional calcifications that are not appreciated on full-field views and should be performed prior to a recommendation for biopsy, and should include 90° lateral and craniocaudal magnification views. When a specific, typically benign etiology cannot be assigned, description of the calcifications should include the morphology, span, location (including distance from nipple), and distribution. Calcifications that are obviously benign need not be reported, especially if the interpreting physician is concerned that the referring provider or patient might infer anything other than absolute confidence in benignity.

It is important to recognize that the algorithms used to reconstruct SM images from the tomosynthesis acquisition may enhance or sometimes alter the appearance of calcifications. Calcifications may appear more conspicuous and coarser on SM. SM views may also contain artifacts that mimic calcifications, termed "pseudocalcifications" [18]. Pseudocalcifications are typically not visible on the DBT slices, confirming their artifactual nature. Faint and/or malignant microcalcifications may sometimes appear less well defined on the SM images due to lower image spatial resolution compared to conventional mammography. As a result, calcification morphology on SM may be incompletely evaluated, necessitating dedicated magnification views for accurate characterization.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Amendments to the MQSA regulations, which took effect on Sept. 10, 2024, resulted in the creation of two new assessment categories under category 0 (replacing the previous combined descriptive verbiage of "Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation and/or prior imaging for comparison"). The two new categories are: Category 0: Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation, used to indicate that the examination is incompletely evaluated, and the recommendation is for additional imaging evaluation (i.e., supplementary mammographic views and/or US); and Category 0: Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison, to be used if retrieval of previous examinations for comparison is indicated before a final assessment can be rendered.

A category 0 "Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation" assessment is almost always used in a screening situation to indicate an abnormal screening examination that is not definitively negative (category 1) or benign (category 2). This reflects the binary nature of screening assessments (positive versus negative) and management recommendations (routine screening versus prompt action). Even when a suspicious abnormality is clearly demonstrated on a screening examination, a category 0 assessment should be used, indicating the need for a complete diagnostic examination to more accurately evaluate the extent of potential disease prior to biopsy. The use of category 0 assessments for all abnormal screening examinations emphasizes that the abnormal interpretation rate should reflect even those screening examinations with findings sufficiently abnormal to justify tissue diagnosis. Once the diagnostic imaging is completed, a final assessment is rendered for the diagnostic examination, but the screening mammography examination remains assessed as category 0.

When feasible, especially if a mammography examination is not assessed as negative or benign, it is recommended that the current examination be compared with prior examination(s), which decreases the frequency of recall [42, 43]. Therefore, assessment category 0 "Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison" should be used for previous image comparison only when such comparison is required to make a final assessment. Most frequently, this involves examinations on which a probably benign finding could be dismissed as benign by the demonstration of stability.

Mammography facilities utilizing a category 0 "Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison" assessment when awaiting prior mammograms should have a tracking procedure in place guaranteeing with 100% reliability that a final assessment will be made within 30 days (preferably sooner), even if prior examinations do not become available. Some mammography practices may reasonably choose never to use category 0 in the context of awaiting prior examinations if they do not have a 100% reliable tracking procedure and rather elect to hold the case for reporting until it is determined if prior exams can be made available. If an "Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison" report is issued while awaiting prior examinations, an addendum to the initial mammography report should be released once prior examinations become available, and the incomplete assessment replaced by a final assessment once the comparison is made. Proper procedures for the auditing of category 0 assessments are described in detail in the Auditing and Outcomes Monitoring section of the Manual. Under rare circumstances, this assessment category may be used in a diagnostic mammography report if the diagnostic evaluation was not fully completed (e.g., a patient electively leaves a facility prior to completing the mammographic views or diagnostic ultrasound). A recommendation for additional imaging evaluation may include the use of spot compression or magnification or other special mammographic views, and/or ultrasound. Category 0 should generally not be used for diagnostic breast imaging findings that warrant further evaluation with MRI. Rather, the interpreting physician should issue a final assessment in a report that is made before the MRI examination is performed. Specifically, category 0 should not be used in cases of a negative or benign mammogram where the interpreting physician

desires the physiologic information afforded by breast MRI due to breast density (e.g., supplemental screening) or clinical symptomology (e.g., suspicious nipple discharge). In these cases, a category 1 or 2 should be given as the mammography assessment, with the discordant management recommendation for breast MRI. Additionally, a category 0 assessment recommending MRI should not be given for further evaluation of findings already deemed suspicious on mammography as a way to potentially defer biopsy. These cases should be assessed as suspicious and given category 4 or 5.

                <div class="document-content">Skin calcifications are usually lucent-centered and pathognomonic in their appearance. They are most commonly seen along the inframammary fold, parasternally, overlying the axilla, and around the areola. The calcifications are usually tightly grouped and < 5 mm in greatest dimension. If suspicious-appearing calcifications are seen adjacent to a skin surface on a given mammographic view, they may still be dermal (hence benign) in nature and tangential-view mammography (with or without magnification) or tomosynthesis (with calcifications in question positioned near detector), should be done if there is uncertainty prior to any intervention to avoid unnecessary biopsy. Calcifications seen on the first few or last few DBT slices (1 mm thick) are typically dermal. However, calcifications seen on subsequent superficial DBT slices may also be dermal if the calcifications lie in skin not touching the compression paddle or detector due to the curvature of the breast. These may also require tangential views to confirm their location.

# 2. SUSPICIOUS MORPHOLOGY

# c. Fine Pleomorphic

Fine pleomorphic calcifications vary in size and shape but are usually < 0.5 mm in diameter. Compared to amorphous calcifications, they are more conspicuous and have discrete shapes. Although variable in shape, they lack the linearity present in fine linear and fine linear-branching morphologies. They have a higher likelihood of malignancy than amorphous or coarse heterogeneous calcifications.

Sound transmission is less attenuated passing through the mass than it is passing through the same thickness of normal tissue on either side of the mass.

Although posterior enhancement is one criterion for diagnosing a simple cyst, importantly, posterior enhancement is not a favorable predictive feature for solid masses [27]. Although some benign masses may demonstrate posterior enhancement, other solid masses, including high-grade carcinomas, may also show enhancement.

Figure 1 – ELASTICITY ASSESSMENT: INTERMEDIATE. Conventional B-mode US imaging (A) shows an irregular hypoechoic mass with microlobulated margin. Corresponding color strain elastogram (B) shows mixed hard and soft stiffness, which is INTERMEDIATE. On this US machine, blue represents hard and red represents soft. With a mixed hard and soft appearance, the 5-point color scale score is 2, which suggests a benign mass. This example supports the recommendation that morphologic characteristics supersede elastography. Since this mass has suspicious morphology, biopsy was still recommended.

Typically, internal vascularity confirms that a mass is solid or has solid components, as cysts do not contain internal blood vessels. When assessing internal vascularity of non-mass lesions, the frame of reference is not simply the presence or absence of internal flow (as with masses) but rather the degree of vascularity compared to normal tissue elsewhere in the breast or a similar location in the contralateral breast. In general, non-mass lesions would be expected to have increased vascularity relative to normal tissue elsewhere in the breast.

It is often used when some of the mass margin is circumscribed but the rest (> 25%) is not visible. By definition, an obscured margin descriptor should not be used when the margin is adjacent to fat. In this case the "indistinct" descriptor should be used (i.e., the margin is visible but not well-defined [see Margin-c. Indistinct]). An obscured margin at screening DM should be reclassified at diagnostic mammography (e.g., spot compression views or at DBT) if an alternative descriptor is more accurate. Obscured margins do not imply either benignity nor suspicion, only that adequate characterization of the margin of the mass cannot be made. In such cases, evaluation of the margin on spot compression views, DBT or ultrasound may provide clarity.

                <div class="document-content">Vascular calcifications present as parallel calcific tracks and are usually clearly associated with arteries. The parallel lines of calcium and the associated vessel may be better depicted on DBT than DM. Vascular calcifications are typically bilateral or seen in more than just an isolated area in one breast. Rarely, if only a few discontinuous calcifications are visible and association with a tubular structure is questionable, additional spot magnification views or a spot compression DBT may be necessary to confirm the relationship with a blood vessel.

Recent evidence suggests that the presence of breast arterial calcifications (BAC) is correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, while a benign finding, the presence of vascular calcifications is of clinical significance [17, 18]. Literature continues to accumulate and there is growing discussion around creating standardized reporting language for BAC, though at this time there is not a consensus on whether the presence of BAC should routinely be reported.

                </div>
                <div class="document-content">Shadowing is caused by attenuation of the ultrasound beam as it passes through the mass, producing a dark column deep to the mass. The shadowing column is darker than the tissue at the same depth to either side of the mass.

Although commonly considered a suspicious feature, shadowing may be associated with both benign and malignant masses. Some malignancies will present as only a band of shadowing with no evident mass.

Previous versions of the BI-RADS Atlas included the posterior feature COMBINED to describe shadowing behind part of a mass and either enhancement or no posterior feature behind the remainder of the mass. The term COMBINED has now been removed because any posterior shadowing, even shadowing behind only part of a mass, is a significant finding that supersedes any other posterior feature. If any part of the mass shadows (other than refractive edge shadowing), then the posterior feature is described as SHADOWING.

A thin line of shadowing may be visible only behind the lateral edges of a curved mass due to a combination of absorption and refraction of the sound beam. This thin refractive edge shadowing is of no significance and should be distinguished from shadowing deep to the body of the mass [28, 29].

SHADOWING. The shadowing is remarkably sharply delineated which is a common feature of some oil cysts. Close inspection of the mammogram (B) confirms a small, round, circumscribed fat-containing mass with rim calcifications diagnostic of an oil cyst (arrow). Simple and complicated cysts will almost never produce posterior shadowing. If shadowing is seen in association with an apparent cyst, and the cyst cannot be confirmed as an oil cyst on mammography, aspiration or tissue sampling is commonly indicated.

Figure 3 – POSTERIOR FEATURES: SHADOWING. Radial (A) and antiradial (B) images of an irregular, non-parallel, anechoic mass with posterior SHADOWING. In this case, the anechogenicity is the result of complete attenuation of the acoustic beam by the mass, rendering any internal echoes within the mass undetectable. This mass was at the site of prior lumpectomy. Although biopsy is typically not necessary to confidently diagnose a surgical scar, this mass enlarged substantially over a short period of time, so biopsy was performed. Pathology: Dense fibrosis with minimal chronic inflammation, consistent with scar.

Enhancement kinetics may be helpful in assessment of MRI findings for which the morphology is not definitively benign or suspicious, and should be reported when the kinetic pattern influences assessment. Kinetic features should not be used as the primary criteria for identification or characterization of MRI findings. When no unique enhancing MRI finding is present, no kinetic assessment is needed.

For clinical breast MRI, semi-quantitative kinetic assessments describing early (previously "initial") and delayed phases are reported. Early phase contrast enhancement describes the enhancement-related signal intensity that occurs in the first 60–120 seconds after contrast injection, and in particular the change in intensity comparing the early time point to the precontrast time point. Delayed phase contrast enhancement describes the enhancement-related signal intensity that occurs after the first 60–120 seconds after contrast injection or when the curve begins to change, and in particular the change in intensity comparing the delayed time point to the early post-contrast time point. The term "initial" was replaced in this version of the Manual because newer "faster" sequences are now available which image at initial timepoints prior to the early phases used in standard imaging.

Many findings have mixed enhancement kinetics. The most suspicious (not most predominant) enhancement types in the early and delayed phase should be reported, because the most suspicious enhancement has been shown to be the most predictive of malignancy [8]. For example, for a finding with early phase fast and medium enhancement, the early phase kinetics should be reported as fast because it is the most suspicious of the early phase enhancement types.

Kinetics are assessed visually and/or using signal time intensity curves generated manually and/or by computer aided evaluation (CAE) systems. CAE system-generated color maps better demonstrate heterogeneity than manually generated signal time intensity curves but are not required for kinetics analysis. CAE generated color maps are not consistent across vendors, and familiarity with the individual colorization for a particular vendor is important for use.

If a pixel's signal intensity increases (persistent) or decreases (washout) by > 10%, different colors are assigned to the pixels. If the signal intensity does not change more than 10% (plateau) in either direction, then it is coded a different color. Delayed phase in this example has been coded as blue for persistent, green for plateau, and red for washout.</div>

                <div class="document-content">Fine linear or fine linear-branching calcifications are thin, linear, irregular calcifications, which may be discontinuous, and are typically < 0.5 mm in caliber. Occasionally, branching forms may be seen. Their appearance suggests filling of the lumen of a duct or ducts by breast cancer, especially ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Among the suspicious calcifications, fine linear and fine linear-branching calcifications have the highest likelihood of being malignant [24].

Figure 2 – Segmental FINE LINEAR-BRANCHING calcifications (DM). Branching forms are seen in this example. Note: Some of these suspicious calcifications are thick rather than fine, but they are irregular and do not taper (as would be seen in large rod-like calcifications). This appearance is highly characteristic of at least DCIS and benign biopsy results would be considered discordant. Pathology: DCIS.

                <div class="document-content">Large rod-like calcifications appear as solid or discontinuous linear rods with well-defined smooth margins and tapering ends. A small percentage of these calcifications may be lucent-centered if the calcium is located in the wall of the duct, but most form within the lumen of the duct. All large rod-like calcifications follow a ductal distribution, converging toward the nipple, occasionally branching, and may be associated with ductal ectasia. These calcifications are typically bilateral, although they may initially be seen in only one breast. Large rod-like calcifications are usually seen in women older than 60 years [19]. Other terms such as plasma cell mastitis or secretory calcifications have been used to describe this type of calcification. However, here and elsewhere, the BI-RADS lexicon describes the morphology rather than the pathophysiologic etiology of the finding.

The triangular arrangement may be composed of multiple merging lines of intraductal calcium which converge toward the nipple, as expected in a ductal system. Segmental calcifications have a higher level of suspicion as they are likely deposits within multiple ducts or ductal branches. This distribution suggests extensive or multifocal breast cancer. Although benign causes of segmental calcifications exist (e.g., large rod-like), this distribution is of concern when the morphology is not typically benign.

# C. ARCHITECTURAL DISTORTION

Architectural distortion is characterized by thin, straight, dense and/or lucent lines radiating from a point, and/or focal retraction or straightening along the edge of the breast parenchyma with no definite mass visible. Architectural distortion may be a primary finding or be secondarily associated with an asymmetry, focal asymmetry or calcifications. Architectural distortion may be more conspicuous on DBT or SM compared to DM, and may present subtly, visible only on DBT slices or only on one view. While architectural distortion is seen more frequently on DBT than DM, the positive predictive value is lower on DBT [27–29]. Nevertheless, architectural distortion that is evident only on DBT remains moderately predictive of malignancy [28–30]. In the absence of a history of trauma or surgery, a recommendation for tissue diagnosis is appropriate, even if no ultrasound correlate is identified. If the architectural distortion is questionable or seen only on one DM or SM view, careful inspection of DBT slices may facilitate identification of superimposed linear structures at different depths as the cause of pseudo-distortion.

Asymmetries are unilateral focal areas of tissue that are detectable because they are unmatched in a mirror image location in the contralateral breast. They have concave contours and are usually interspersed with fat. Asymmetries do not conform to the definition of a mass, which has a radiodense center and at least partially convex contour. There are three types of asymmetries. In this version of BI-RADS, the developing asymmetry descriptor has been removed to be consistent with the remaining lexicon, where delineation of change over time is not embedded in the descriptor terminology. However, as described later, the clinical importance of a focal asymmetry that is enlarging, becoming denser or more conspicuous must be recognized.</div>

# 2. SUSPICIOUS MORPHOLOGY

Classification of breast calcifications by morphology is useful to predict the likelihood of malignancy. There are four calcification morphology descriptors that usually indicate sufficient suspicion for malignancy to prompt a biopsy recommendation.

                <div class="document-content">Breast cancer generally metastasizes via lymphatic (rather than hematogenous) spread. Hence, malignancy must be considered in the setting of an abnormal node at ultrasound. At the same time, there are many benign or non-breast-cancer etiologies for an abnormal node, such as autoimmune processes, connective tissue disorders, granulomatous disease, lymphoma, or vaccine-related adenopathy (as seen with COVID-19, influenza, pneumococcus, shingles, and other vaccinations). Correlation with clinical history is of utmost importance for optimal patient management.

The margin of any mass with an echogenic rind is considered NON-CIRCUMSCRIBED and is often INDISTINCT.

Figure 5 – MARGIN: INDISTINCT. Radial (A) and antiradial (B) images of a hypoechoic, oval mass with parallel orientation and posterior enhancement. Although portions of the margin appear circumscribed, some of the margin is INDISTINCT (arrow), so the mass is defined as INDISTINCT. The presence of an echogenic rind (arrowhead) also defines the mass as non-circumscribed. Posterior enhancement in a solid mass is not a reassuring sign. Pathology: Invasive mucinous carcinoma.

- 3. MARGIN
  - b. Non-circumscribed
    - ii. Microlobulated

The margin is characterized by short-cycle 2–3 mm undulations or ripples. Microlobulated describes the margin while lobulated describes the shape of a mass. Microlobulations are typically more numerous but are less deep than the lobulations that define a lobulated shape. This term was purposefully retained in the ultrasound section (but discontinued in the Mammography section) because the feature is easily discernable with current ultrasound equipment and technique as a mass undergoes real-time interrogation of its surface features and provides an added descriptor that can assist in differentiating benign from suspicious masses. The significant feature is that the mass is non-circumscribed.
